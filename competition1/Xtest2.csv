4,Convert for loop to apply,"<p>In R, how do you replace the following code using functions like <code>apply</code>, <code>lapply</code>, <code>rapply</code>, <code>do.call</code>, etc.? </p>

<pre><code>u &lt;- 10:12
slist &lt;- list()

for (i in 1:length(u)) {
  p &lt;- combn(u, i) 
  for (j in 1:ncol(p)) {
    s &lt;- paste(p[,j], collapse="","")
    slist[[s]] &lt;- 0
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p><br></p>

<p>For this part: </p>

<pre><code>  for (j in 1:ncol(p)) {
    s &lt;- paste(p[,j], collapse="","")
</code></pre>

<p>I tried something like:</p>

<pre><code>  s &lt;- apply(p, 2, function(x) paste(x, collapse="",""))
</code></pre>

<p>Which works. But then for that <code>slist[[s]] &lt;- 0</code> part inside that same for-loop, I don't know what to do. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> This is what I'm trying to do. For the vector <code>u</code>, I'm producing a list of all the subsets in that vector. Then for each subset, I'm assigning it to <code>s</code>, then using the string <code>s</code> as the name of an element in <code>slist</code>. Kind of strange, I know, but it's for a homework assignment. For the code above, this would be the first 5 elements of slist: </p>

<pre><code> &gt; slist
 $`10`
 [1] 0

 $`11`
 [1] 0

 $`12`
 [1] 0

 $`10,11`
 [1] 0

 $`10,12`
 [1] 0
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah, I'm just trying to learn how to use apply and stuff properly. </p>

6,How to produce HTML tables and accompanying CSS using R Markdown or HTML Sweave?,"<p>I previously asked a question about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/q/10774285/180892"">how to export a HTML table in R and have control over line borders</a>. </p>

<p>I'm used to LaTeX where when you create a table, the formatting of the table is largely determined by the text and markup that appears at that point. This works well for Sweave, because your R code chunk can output LaTeX table markup at that point. I also understand that there are tools like <code>xtable</code> that can produce HTML markup for a table.</p>

<p>However, control over HTML tables seems to rely on style sheets, which are meant to appear in the header of the document and not in the location where the R code chunk is placed. Of course, I could just put content in the style sheet, but in scientific applications often there can be some quite specific table formatting that varies in some respects from table to table.</p>

<p>Thus, my question:</p>

<ul>
<li>In general, how do you format an HTML table with literate programming like R Markdown or even from raw HTML if formatting of the output requires output to be created in a separate place in the document (i.e., CSS for the table in the header) to where the R code chunk is placed (i.e.,the table itself in the body)?</li>
</ul>

                     `Financial analysts`=4,  Nurses=5)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I'm looking for the easiest way to replace the values in  <code>df$profession</code> with the text found in <code>profession.code</code>. Preferably without use of special libraries, unless it shortens the code significantly.</p>

<p>I would like my end result to be</p>

13,"Using pytables, which is more efficient: scipy.sparse or numpy dense matrix?","<p>When using <code>pytables</code>, there's no support (as far as I can tell) for the <code>scipy.sparse</code> matrix formats, so to store a matrix I have to do some conversion, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>def store_sparse_matrix(self):
    grp1 = self.getFileHandle().createGroup(self.getGroup(), 'M')
    self.getFileHandle().createArray(grp1, 'data', M.tocsr().data)

def get_sparse_matrix(self):

The problem is that the second plot needs repositioning as soon as the medium size changes.</p>

47,Efficiency of floating point division and checking values beforehand if eq,"<p>I have a situation where I <em>might</em> need to apply a multiplier to a value in order to get the correct results.  This involves computing the value using floating point division.</p>

<p>I'm thinking it would be a good idea to check the values before I perform floating point logic on them to save processor time, however I'm not sure how efficient it will be at run-time either way.</p>

<p>I'm assuming that the <code>if</code> check is 1 or 2 instructions (been a while since assembly class), and that the floating point operation is going to be many more than that.</p>

<pre><code>//Check 
if (a != 10) {              //1 or 2 instructions?
    b *= (float) a / 10;    //Many instructions?
}
</code></pre>

<p>Value <code>a</code> is going to be '10' most of the time, however there are a few instances where it wont be.  Is the floating point division going to take very many cycles even if <code>a</code> is equal to the divisor?</p>

<p>Will the previous code with the <code>if</code> statement execute more efficiently than simply the next one without?</p>

<pre><code>//Don't check
b *= (float) a / 10;    //Many instructions?

<p>Granted there wont be any noticable difference either way, however I'm curious as to the behavior of the floating point multiplication when the divisor is equal to the dividend in case things get processor heavy.</p>
"
48,What machine learning algorithm is appropriate for predicting one time-series from another?,"<p>You are a plane tracking an enemy ship that travels across the ocean, so you have collected a series of (x,y,time) coordinates of the ship. You know that a hidden submarine travels with the ship to protect it, but while there is a correlation between their positions, the submarine often wanders off from the ship, so while it's often near it, it can also be on the other side of the world occasionally. You want to predict the path of the submarine, but unfortunately it is hidden from you.</p>

<p>But one month in April you notice the submarine forgets to hide itself, so you have a series of coordinates for both the submarine and the ship throughout 1,000 trips. Using this data, you'd like to build a model to predict the hidden submarine's path given just the ship's movements. The naive baseline would be to say ""submarine position guess = ""ship's current position"" but from the April data where the submarine was visible, you notice there is a tendency for the submarine to be ahead of the ship a bit, so ""submarine position guess = ship's position in 1 minute"" is an even better estimate. Furthermore, the April data shows that when the ship pauses in the water for an extended period, the submarine is likely to be far away patrolling the coastal waters. There are other patterns of course.</p>

<p>How would you build this model, given the April data as training data, to predict the submarine's path? My current solution is an ad-hoc linear regression where the factors are ""trip time"", ""cargo ship's x coordinate"", ""was cargo ship idle for 1 day"", etc. and then having R figure out the weights and doing a cross-validation. But I would really love a way to generate these factors automatically from the April data. Also, a model that uses sequence or time would be nice, since the linear regression doesn't and I think it's relevant.</p>

<p>Edit: I've reformulated the problem with a made-up story so it's a less confusing. The original problem I posted is:</p>

<p>I have eye-tracking data on two subjects -- a teacher, and a student. It's in the form (x, y, time), so there is a series of these for each subject. What the teacher looks at influences what the student looks at. What method would I use to predict what the student is looking at, using only teacher data? Lets say I can train some learning algorithm using a gold standard set of student and teacher data.</p>

<p>I was thinking hidden markov model would be appropriate, given the definition in Wikipedia, but I am not sure how to put this into practice over my dataset.</p>

<p>More detail: I have data about how a teacher and student each look at a map and some readings. I have 40 of these datasets, which look like [(366,234,0), (386,234,5), ...] which means the teacher looked at point (366,234) at time 0 and then 5 seconds later moved up to look at coordinate (386, 234). I can to learn a model to understand the relationship between how a teacher looks at content, to predict how a student will look at the same content. So maybe the student looks at the content in the same order as the teacher but slower. Or perhaps the student doesn't look around as much but the teacher scans more of the content. I have both sets of data and want to see how accurate of a model I can get -- would I be able to predict the student's looking behavior within 50px of the teacher's looking behavior?</p>

65,order rows in a matrix based on the index of most similar row in another matrix,"<p>I am trying to ""unshuffle"" the rows of a matrix containing the centroids of some clusters which are not in the same order as the order in which the samples were assigned to the clusters. Initially I was comparing the absolute value of the distance between the data points of the mean and the cluster centers and assign the index of the row which had the smallest distance. Of course, I am not allowed to have duplicate indexes. It worked pretty good but the symmetric values raise a problem (i.e., due to the absolute value for the distance, mirror clusters were not ordered properly). Also I tried to order them based on the variance, did not work as expected. I have been looking at the order() and sort() function and found an example which did not work.</p>

order(mean)[centers]

69,"In R, how do you get the best fitting equation to a set of data?","<p>I'm not sure wether R can do this (I assume it can, but maybe that's just because I tend to assume that R can do anything :-)). What I need is to find the best fitting equation to describe a dataset.</p>

<p>For example, if you have these points:</p>

<p><code>df = data.frame(x = c(1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100), y = c(100, 75, 50, 40, 30, 25))</code></p>

<p>How do you get the best fitting equation? I know that you can get the best fitting curve with:</p>

<pre><code>plot(loess(df$y ~ df$x))
</code></pre>

<p>But as I understood you can't extract the equation, see <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1785118/loess-fit-and-resulting-equation"">Loess Fit and Resulting Equation</a>.</p>

<p>When I try to build it myself (note, I'm not a mathematician, so this is probably not the ideal approach :-)), I end up with smth like:</p>

<pre><code>y.predicted = 12.71 + ( 95 / (( (1 + df$x) ^ .5 ) / 1.3))
</code></pre>

<p>Which kind of seems to approximate it - but I can't help to think that smth more elegant probably exists :-)</p>

<p>I have the feeling that fitting a linear or polynomial model also wouldn't work, because the formula seems different from what those models generally use (i.e. this one seems to need divisions, powers, etc). For example, the approach in <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3822535/fitting-polynomial-model-to-data-in-r"">Fitting polynomial model to data in R</a> gives pretty bad approximations.</p>

<p>I remember from a long time ago that there exist languages (Matlab may be one of them?) that do this kind of stuff. Can R do this as well, or am I just at the wrong place?</p>

<p>(Background info: basically, what we need to do is find an equation for determining numbers in the second column based on the numbers in the first column; but we decide the numbers ourselves. We have an idea of how we want the curve to look like, but we can adjust these numbers to an equation if we get a better fit. It's about the pricing for a product (a cheaper alternative to current expensive software for qualitative data analysis); the more 'project credits' you buy, the cheaper it should become. Rather than forcing people to buy a given number (i.e. 5 or 10 or 25), it would be nicer to have a formula so people can buy exactly what they need - but of course this requires a formula. We have an idea for some prices we think are ok, but now we need to translate this into an equation.</p>

E(\|\sum_{j=1}^M\epsilon_jB_j\|^{2n}_{S_{2n}})\leq \frac{(2n)!}{2^nn!}\max\{\|(\sum_{j=1}^MB_jB^*_j)^{1/2}\|^{2n}_{S_{2n}}, \|(\sum_{j=1}^MB^*_jB_j)^{1/2}\|^{2n}_{S_{2n}}\},

where $\|\cdot\|_{S_{2n}}$ is a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schatten_norm"" rel=""nofollow"">Schatten norm</a>, and $B_jB^*_j$ together with $B_j^*B_j$ are positive self-adjoint matrices.</p>

<p>I am curious, if this is a critical condition for Rademacher random variables $\epsilon_j, j=1, \ldots, M$ been independent. I mean, would it make science if one can consider some dependence between $\epsilon_j$, say sum of them is equal to 1.</p>

91,Pythonic way to populate numpy array,"<p>I find myself parsing lots of data files (usually in a .csv file or similar) using the csv reader and a for loop to iterate over every line. The data is usually a table of floats so for example.</p>

<pre><code>reader = csv.reader(open('somefile.csv'))
header = reader.next()

res_list = [list() for i in header]    

for line in reader:
  for i in range(len(line)):
    res_list[i].append(float(line[i]))

result_dict = dict(zip(header,res_list)) #so we can refer by column title
</code></pre>

<p>This is a ok way to populate so I get each column as a separate list however, I would prefer that the default data container for lists of items (and nested lists) be numpy arrays, since 99 times out 100 the numbers get pumped into various processing scripts/functions and having the power of numpy lists makes my life easier. </p>

<p>The numpy <code>append(arr, item)</code> doesn't append in-place and therefore would require re-creating arrays for every point in the table (which is slow and unneccesary). I could also iterate over the list of data-columns and wrap them into an array after I'm done (which is what I've been doing), but sometimes it isn't so clear cut about <em>when</em> I'm done parsing the file and may need to append stuff to the list later down the line anyway.</p>

<p>I was wondering if there is some less-boiler-heavy way (to use the overused phrase ""pythonic"") to process tables of data in a similar way, or to populate arrays (where the underlying container is a list) dynamically and without copying arrays all the time.</p>

<p>(On another note: its kind of annoying that in general people use columns to organize data but <code>csv</code> reads in rows if the reader incorporated a read_column argument (yes, I know it wouldn't be super efficient), I think many people would avoid having boiler plate code like the above to parse a csv data file. )</p>

102,Standard error of the mean for root mean square of data,"<p>If I have a distribution of data, X, representing N samples taken during one measurement, then the mean square of X is $\bar{X^2} = \langle X^2 \rangle$, the variance of $X^2$, $\mathrm{var}(X^2)$ is $\langle\langle X^4 \rangle - \langle X^2 \rangle \rangle$, and the standard error of the mean square is $\sqrt{\frac{\mathrm{var}(X^2)}{N}}$.</p>

<p>Thus, the standard error of the mean square represents one standard deviation of the distribution that would be produced by repeating the measurement (taking N samples each time), assuming that $X^2$ is normally distributed with the variance of the original measurement.</p>

<p>What is the standard error of the quantity $\sqrt{\langle X^2 \rangle}$ (the standard error of the root mean square?)?</p>

<p>A rephrasing:  assume Y is normally distributed with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2$.  Define Z = $\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_1^N Y_i}$ What is the variance of Z?</p>

107,What data stucture should I use for BigInt class,"<p>I would like to implement a BigInt class which will be able to handle really big numbers. I want only to add and multiply numbers, however the class should also handle negative numbers. </p>

<p>I wanted to represent the number as a string, but there is a big overhead with converting string to int and back for adding. I want to implement addition as on the high school, add corresponding order and if the result is bigger than 10, add the carry to next order. </p>

<p>Then I thought that it would be better to handle it as a array of unsigned long long int and keep the sign separated by bool. With this I'm afraid of size of the int, as C++ standard as far as I know guarantees only that int &lt; float &lt; double. Correct me if I'm wrong. So when I reach some number I should move in array forward and start adding number to the next array position. </p>

108,Hypothesis testing approach,"<p>I have the following situation. I'm studying how malicious host on the internet choose their victims. I must discover if a number of host are acting an in independent way or not. I'm using an hypothesis testing approach:</p>

<ul>
<li>The null hypothesis is that the host scan the internet in a independent fashion</li>
<li>The alternative hypothesis is that they scan coordinately</li>
</ul>

<p>Stating that the first is true (independent scan) we can calculate the distribution of the number of destination ip addresses that receive no scanning.
My question is, given that distribution how can I prove that the host scan in an independent fashion? In particular, I am observing a certain number of ip addresses.
From this observation I can say what is the number of addresses that have not received any scanning. Using only that number and the given distribution can I use some type of test to prove the null hypothesis?</p>

<p>Another idea was to divide the addresses I'm observing in a series of groups and use the chi square goodness fit test. Do you think that this approach will be formally correct?</p>

I found a number of old articles/questions (circa 2009) suggesting that this is possible by using <code>k=-1</code> as an argument.  However, when I attempt this, I get an error.</p>

<p>I would appreciate any help.  If anyone has another suggestion for a package to use for lagging, I'm all ears.  However, I do love <code>plm</code> because it automagically deals with lagging across multiple individuals and skips gaps in the time series.</p>

123,How to improve a spatial raster map using ggplot when compared to spplot?,"<p>How can I improve the legend of spatial raster map plot using ggplot when compared to a spplot() legend?</p>

<p>I would like plot spatial maps using ggplot() instead of ssplot() however there are a few things that I would like to improve when compared to the spplot:</p>

<ol>
<li>create a ggplot legend that goes from small (bottom) to large values (top)  </li>
<li>Have the breaks in the ggplot legend similar to the ssplot() legend so that I know what the boundaries are of each color.  </li>

127,Theoretical proof of convergence of sequential weight update procedure (Neural Networks and Machine Learning),"<p>My question is at the bottom.
(Most of the descriptive words come from Chris. Bishop's <em>Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition</em>)</p>

<p>let $w$ be the weight vector of the neural network and $E$ the error function. </p>

<p>According to the Robbins-Monro algorithm, this $$w_{kj}^{(r+1)}=w_{kj}^{(r)}-\eta\left.\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{kj}}\right|_{w^{(r)}}$$ will converge to where $$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{kj}}=0$$</p>

<p>In general the error function is given by a sum of terms each of which is calculated using one of the patterns from the training set, so that $$E=\sum_nE^n(w)$$
And in applications we just update the weight vector using one pattern at a time $$w_{kj}^{(r+1)}=w_{kj}^{(r)}-\eta\frac{\partial E^n}{\partial w_{kj}}$$</p>

<p>My question is: Why the algorithm will converge using the last formula? Once we use it to update the $w$, the value of $w$ is changed, I can't prove the convergence using $$\frac{\partial E}{\partial w_{kj}}=\sum_n \frac{\partial E^n}{\partial w_{kj}}$$</p>

128,How to analyze risk vs. reward for spending on research and development work?,"<p>Imagine I have a company that makes widgets, where each widget costs me A dollars to make. Each month I can allocate money toward research and development with the aim of finding a new process that will allow me to build widgets for a cost of A/B dollars. Presume that I know that for each C dollars I spend on research and development there's a D% chance of finding a breakthrough. Of course, spending money on research and development means that I have less to spend on building widgets.</p>

<p>I have a monthly budget of E dollars. This budget is not directly tied to my profit margin, but it is safe to say that it my profit margins influence future budgets (i.e., if I make no widgets for three straight months b/c I do all research and development, it's likely that my budget will be reduced, whereas if I discover a breakthrough the first month my profits will skyrocket and I'll likely see that budget grow over time).</p>

<p>In case that is too abstract, here's the real world scenario I'm interested in solving (although I'd like a more general approach, as well):</p>

<ul>
<li>A = 15 dollars</li>
<li>B = 3</li>
<li>C = 5 dollars</li>
<li>D = 2.75%</li>
<li>E = 30 dollars</li>
</ul>

<p>That is, today widgets cost me 15 dollars to build but if I can find a breakthrough I know I can make them at 1/3 the cost (5 dollars). For each 5 dollars I spend on research and development there is a 2.75% chance I'll find the breakthrough. However, I have only 30 dollars to spend each month. If I spend it all on research and development and have no success then I have made no widgets for sale. If I spend it all on widget construction I have no chance of finding a breakthrough.</p>

<p>Is there some statistical distribution or formula that can let me plug in these variables and see some sort of breakdown that gives me an idea of whether it's a good idea to spend any money on research and development each month and, if so, how much?</p>

143,For loop skipping large part of data set,"<p>I have another problem with my data set. Basically, there is a list of genes with associated features including position numbs (columns 3 and 4) and strand orientation (+ or -). I am trying to do a calculation with the positions to make them relative to the start codon TYPE (second column) for each gene, rather than the entire genome (as it is now). The problem is that, the calculation is only performed on the + STRAND sequences, the - STRAND sequences are not showing up in the output. Below is a sample of the data set, my code, the output, and what I've tried.</p>

<p>Here's the data set:</p>

<pre><code>    GENE_ID TYPE    POS1    POS2    STRAND

PITG_00003  CDS 38775   39068   +

<p>Here is the code:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy

So next I tried only doing this part:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy

##sys.stdout = open(""outtry2.txt"", ""w"")
data = pd.read_csv('pinfestans-edited2.csv', sep='\t')#,

groups = data.groupby(['STRAND', 'GENE_ID'])

corrected = []

for (direction, gene_name), group in groups:
    print direction,gene_name
</code></pre>

<p>And the output printed out all the GENE_IDs and their STRAND symbol (+ or -), and it did it for both the + and - sequences. So somewhere below that it isn't selecting any of the sequences with - in the STRAND column.</p>

<p>So I tried adding this to the original code:</p>

<pre><code>if direction == '+':
    group['POSA'] = 1 + abs(group.POS1 - group.POS1[start_exon])
    group['POSB'] = 1 + abs(group.POS2 - group.POS1[start_exon])
elif direction == '-':
    group['POSA'] = 1 - abs(group.POS2 - group.POS2[start_exon])
    group['POSB'] = 1 - abs(group.POS1 - group.POS2[start_exon])
else:
    break
print group
# put into the result array
corrected.append(group)
</code></pre>

<p>and this is the very end of the output, it printed the first - and then froze for awhile before ending:</p>

<pre><code>+
        GENE_ID     TYPE         POS1    POS2    STRAND  POSA  POSB

  <p>JRI is a Java/R Interface, which allows to run R inside Java
  applications as a single thread.
  Basically it loads R dynamic library
  into Java and provides a Java API to R
  functionality. It supports both simple
  calls to R functions and a full
  running REPL.</p>
  
  <p>In a sense JRI is the inverse of rJava
  and both can be combined (i.e. you can
  run R code inside JRI that calls back
  to the JVM via rJava). The JGR project
  makes the full use of both JRI and
  rJava to provide a full Java GUI for
  R.</p>
  
  <p>JRI uses native code, but it supports
  all platforms where Sun's Java (or
  compatible) is available, including
  Windows, Mac OS X, Sun and Linux (both
  32-bit and 64-bit).</p>

"
150,r reshape data long to wide with unknown number of columns,"<p>I'm sure this is trivial but I can't find how to do it.</p>

<p>I have a data frame in which there are individuals, each of which can have several properties, and each property is classified in a number of ways. Currenly it's in long shape, with a record looking like (in schematic form, actually it's a little more complicated):</p>

<pre><code>IndividualID Property PropClass 
1            X         A 
1            Y         B 
2            X         A 
3            Y         B
3            W         C
3            Z         A
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is one row for each individual ID, with the individual ID and then pairs of columns for each property and PropClass that that individual has on the original file, so in this case:</p>

<pre><code> IndividualID  Prop1   PropClass1 Prop2  PropClass2  Prop3  PropClass3
 1             X       A          Y      B           NA     NA
 2             X       A          NA     NA          NA     NA
 3             Y       B          W      C           Z      A
</code></pre>

<p>So there have to be as many Prop and PropClass variables as the maximum number of rows for any individualID in the original data set (which is not large, about 5), and where an individual has fewer rows in the original dataset than that maximum number, the extra columns that don't mean anything for that individual have NAs in them. The order of the Prop and PropClass variables for an individual doesn't matter (though it may as well be the original order on the long format file). </p>

<p>Obviously it's easy to do this (e.g. using reshape) if you have one pair of Prop and propClass columns for every possible value of Prop, but there are several hundred possible values of Prop so the file gets huge and unhelpful. I can't believe there is not a simple way to do what I want, but I haven't found it despite what seems to me to be assiduous searching. Please tell me I'm being an idiot, and if so, how I might cure my idiocy.</p>

152,Quickly apply xts vector operations across wide zoo objects in R,"<p>This is really an extension of my <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4309248/aggregate-by-week-in-r"">question</a> yesterday where I learned about <code>apply.weekly</code>. This works great, but I want to do this over wide <code>zoo</code> objects. If I use <code>apply.weekly</code> on a wide <code>zoo</code> it sums the columns, then performs the weekly aggregation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; library(xts)
&gt; set.seed(2001)
&gt; zoo.daily &lt;- zoo(data.frame(a=rnorm(20), b=rnorm(20), c=rnorm(20)), order.by=as.Date(""2001-05-25"") + 0:19)
&gt; apply.weekly(zoo.daily, sum)
2001-05-27 2001-06-03 2001-06-10 2001-06-13 
  1.091999  -3.017688   3.842305   2.045370 
&gt; apply.weekly(zoo.daily[, 1] + zoo.daily[, 2] + zoo.daily[, 3], sum) 
2001-05-27 2001-06-03 2001-06-10 2001-06-13 
  1.091999  -3.017688   3.842305   2.045370 
</code></pre>

<p>I tried the <code>apply</code> family of operators, but those seem to strip out the <code>zoo</code> date index. I can do it in a <code>for</code> loop, but it's really time-consuming (much, much more than a factor of four slower than the <code>aggregate</code> function on <code>as.yearmon</code> periodicity). Here's the <code>for</code> loop:</p>

<pre><code>week.ends &lt;- index(zoo.daily[endpoints(zoo.daily, ""weeks"")[-1], ])
num.weeks &lt;- nweeks(zoo.daily)
num.stocks &lt;- ncol(zoo.daily)
zoo.weeks &lt;- zoo(matrix(NA, num.weeks, num.stocks), order.by=week.ends)
for (i in seq(num.stocks)) {
    zoo.weeks[, i] &lt;- apply.weekly(zoo.daily[, i], mean)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Which works (i.e., keeps each vector separate):</p>

<pre><code>2001-05-27 -0.36663040 -0.108648725  0.8392788

</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to quickly operate on all columns with <code>apply.weekly</code>? Thanks!</p>

<p>UPDATE: Joshua Ulrich points out that I need a column aware function (like <code>colMeans</code> or <code>colSums</code>). When I do this, I get the correct answers, but as a transposed matrix. Should I just reclass and move on? Or do I have an option/setting wrong?</p>

<pre><code>&gt; apply.weekly(zoo.daily, colSums)
        [,1]        [,2]       [,3]        [,4]

<p>A = {x is an element of the set of Natural Numbers | for every y greater than x, 2y is the sum of two primes}</p>

<p>I'm inclined to think that this is decidable given the fact that when fed into a Turing Machine, it will never reach an accept state and loop for infinity unless it rejects.  However, I also do know that for a language to be decidable, there must only exist an algorithm to decide it; we don't necessarily have to know how it's done.

161,Remove an arbitrary rotation axis from a rotation matrix,"<p>I'm currently working on a tilt compensated linear accelerometer on an android phone. What i basically want to reach is the acceleration, which is in the earth frame, rather than sensor frame. I also want make my vector gravity free. X-axis of the accelerometer will be alligned seperately with the x-axis of a land vehicle. Therefore yaw compensation (angle between the x axis of the phone and magnetic north) is not wanted.</p>

<p>For this we have 2 sensor readings:</p>

<p>1) 3x3 rotation matrix <strong><em>R</em></strong> (rotation from earth frame to sensor frame)</p>

<p>2) 3x1 acceleration vector <strong><em>a = (x,y,z)^T</em></strong> from sensor frame</p>

<p>To manually remove gravity from <strong>a_transposed</strong> we can simply define a gravity vector in earth frame:</p>

<p>g = (0,0,9.81)^T </p>

<p>I can now multiply gravity with rotation matrix R and substract it from <strong><em>a</em></strong> vector. As a result <strong><em>a'</em></strong> is the gravity free acceleration vector.</p>

<p>a' = a - (R * g)
(at this step a' has the same values as the software sensor LINEAR_ACCELERATION in API)</p>

<p>Until here everything works fine. </p>

<p>Now i want to rotate my linear acceleration vector <strong><em>a'</em></strong> in the earth frame <strong>without taking Z-axis rotation in to account</strong>. In order to do so first i calculate the inverse of the rotation matrix R, which is equal to the tranpose of it:</p>

<p>R^(-1) = R^T</p>

<p>Then i multiply <strong><em>a'</em></strong> with <strong><em>R^(-1)</em></strong> and rotate it back to earth frame.</p>

<p>a' = R^(-1) * a'</p>

<p>At this step I have a tilt compensated linear acceleration data, if my phone is facing magnetic north, because i have also rotated around z axis, which is not needed. I have to rerotate it around z-axis to get the final right result. For this purpose i have calculated the euler angle (rotation around z axis) from the rotation matrix, which is yaw. And rotated my vector once in the opposite direction by using the yaw angle. This should be the final correction step but there is a cost using euler angles.</p>

<p>This method does not work if i hold the phone directly upwards, beacause if the roll angle is equal to 90 degrees and it causes a gimbal lock. My calculated yaw angle is then <em>unknown</em> and my back-rotation fails.</p>

<p>My question is how to modify/change the rotation matrix so that i can only rotate around x and y axis by ignoring z axis, without using euler angles? </p>

<p>i have alread checked but it didnt helped me:

<p>Edit (jterrace answered the original question):
The data is coming in the form of an N*M Numpy array. Each row is mostly zeros, occasionally interspersed by sequences of non-zero numbers. <strong>I want to replace all elements of each such sequence with the last value of the sequence. I'll take any fast method to do this!</strong> Using where and diff a few times, we can get the start and stop indices of each run.</p>

<pre><code>raw_data = array([.....][....])
starts = array([0,0,0,1,1,1,1...][3, 9, 32, 7, 22, 45, 57,....])
stops = array([0,0,0,1,1,1,1...][5, 12, 50, 10, 30, 51, 65,....])
last_values = raw_data[stops]
length_to_repeat = stops[1]-starts[1]
</code></pre>

<p>Note that starts[0] and stops[0] are the same information (which row the run is occurring on). At this point, since the only route I know of is what jterrace suggest, we'll need to go through some contortions to get similar start/stop positions for the zeros, then interleave the zero start/stop with the values start/stops, and interleave the number 0 with the last_values array. Then we loop over each row, doing something like:</p>

<pre><code>for i in range(N)
    values_in_this_row = where(starts[0]==i)[0]
    output[i] = numpy.repeat(last_values[values_in_this_row], length_to_repeat[values_in_this_row])

166,Detecting rare incidents from multivariate time series intervals,"<p>Given a time series of sensor state intervals, how do I implement a classifier which learns from supervised training data to detect an incident based on a sequence of state intervals? To simplify the problem, sensor states are reduced to either <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> I've found <a href=""http://fuzzy.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/wiki/uploads/Mitarbeiter.Kempe/Mining_Sequences_of_Temporal_Intervals.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper (PDF)</a> on <em>Mining Sequences of Temporal Intervals</em> which addresses a similar problem. <a href=""http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache%3azBDmsljfWmUJ%3aciteseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download%3Fdoi%3D10.1.1.88.603%26rep%3Drep1%26type%3Dpdf+Mining+Hierarchical+Temporal+Patterns+in+Multivariate+Time+Series+site%3a.edu&amp;hl=en&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESivIUmQ69g2JVOM0G07NVLuehGh8Nn95DkffNcctH6_u8xti38b7WQadxgfEX8Nh1gvOcRHha_QRpDqGuf1uM8wZeZCcVFzC-MjNXxmC-GhEWCxLadKiBApOx-6BRjxD-8UU5i0&amp;sig=AHIEtbRcfxh9KxfqyOMxfePG7aXtRPpQVA"" rel=""nofollow"">Another paper (Google Docs)</a> on <em>Mining Hierarchical Temporal Patterns in Multivariate Time Series</em> takes a novel approach, but deals with hierarchical data.</p>

<h2>Example Training Data</h2>

<p>The following data is a training example for an incident, represented as a graph over time, where <code>/¯¯¯\</code> represents a <code>true</code> state interval and <code>\___/</code> a <code>false</code> state interval for a sensor.</p>

<pre><code> Sensor   |  Sensor State over time
          |  0....5....10...15...20...25...  // timestamp
 ---------|--------------------------------
 A        |  ¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\________/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
 B        |  ¯¯¯¯¯\___________________/¯¯¯¯
 C        |  ______________________________  // no state change
 D        |  /¯\_/¯\_/¯\_/¯\_/¯\_/¯\_/¯\_/¯
 E        |  _________________/¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯\___
</code></pre>

<h2>Incident Detection vs Sequence Labeling vs Classification</h2>

<p>I initially generalised my problem as a two-category sequence labeling problem, but my categories really represented ""normal operation"" and a rare ""alarm event"" so I have rephrased my question as incident detection. Training data is available for ""normal operation"" and ""alarm incident"".</p>

<p>To reduce problem complexity, I have discretized sensor events to boolean values, but this need not be the case.</p>

<h2>Possible Algorithms</h2>

<p>A hidden Markov model seems to be a possible solution, but would it be able to use the state intervals? If a sequence labeler is not the best approach for this problem, alternative suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>Bayesian Probabilistic Approach</h2>

<p>Sensor activity will vary significantly by time of day (busy in mornings, quiet at night). My initial approach would have been to measure normal sensor state over a few days and calculate state probability by time of day (hour). The combined probability of sensor states at an unlikely hour surpassing an ""unlikelihood threshold"" would indicate an incident. But this seemed like it would raise a false alarm if the sensors were noisy. I have not yet implemented this, but I believe that approach has merit.</p>

<h2>Feature Extraction</h2>

<p>Vector states could be represented as state interval changes occurring at a specific time and lasting a specific duration.</p>

<pre><code>struct StateInterval
{
    int sensorID;
    bool state;
    DateTime timeStamp;
    TimeSpan duration; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>eg. Some State Intervals from the process table:</p>

<pre><code>[ {D, true, 0, 3} ]; [ {D, false, 4, 1} ]; ...
[ {A, true, 0, 12} ]; [ {B, true, 0, 6} ]; [ {D, true, 0, 3} ]; etc.
</code></pre>

<p>A good classifier would take into account state-value intervals and recent state changes to determine if a combination of state changes closely matches training data for a category.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Some ideas after sleeping on how to extract features from multiple sensors' alarm data and how to compare it to previous data...</p>

<p>Start by calculating the following data for each sensor for each hour of the day:</p>

<ul>
<li>Average state interval length (for <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> states)</li>
<li>Average time between state changes</li>
<li>Number of state changes over time</li>
</ul>

<p>Each sensor could then be compared to every other sensor in a matrix with data like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Average time taken for sensor B to change to a true state after sensor A did. If an average value is 60 seconds, then a 1-second wait would be more interesting than a 120-second wait.</li>
<li>Average number of state changes sensor B underwent while sensor A was in one state</li>
</ul>

<p>Given two sets of training data, the classifier should be able to determine from these feature sets which is the most likely category for classification.</p>

<p>Is this a sensible approach and what would be a good algorithm to compare these features?</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> the direction of a state change (<code>false-&gt;true</code> vs <code>true-false</code>) is significant, so any features should take that into account.</p>

171,Order statistics and their CDF,"<p>Here's a problem that seems rather peculiar to me. This time I have no initial idea about how to solve it.</p>

<p>Let $X_1$, ..., $X_n$ be independent, real valued random variables with density $f$ and CDF $F$. Let $F_i$ denote the CDF of $X_{(i)}$.</p>

<p>a) What is the distribution of $F(X_{(i)})$ and $F_i(X_{(i)})$?</p>

<p>b) What is the variance of $F(X_{(i)})$?</p>

<p>[edit: I have realised by now that my approach was flawed and furthermore that my question needs clarification. So here is my second try.]</p>

<p>As I understand the question, we have real valued, i.i.d. random variables $X_1$, ..., $X_n$ with density $f$ and CDF $F$.</p>

<p>$X_{(1)}&lt; ... &lt; X_{(n)}$ are the corresponding order statistics with CDF $F_i:=F_{X_{(i)}}$.</p>

<p>I know the general formula for the CDF of order statistics. It is given by $$F_i(t)=\sum_{k=i}^n \binom{n}{k}F(t)^k(1-F(t))^{n-k}.$$</p>

<p>Now, the CDF of a random variable is a measurable function. Thus $F(X_{(i)})$ and $F_i(X_{(i)})$ are real valued random variables again. And a) asks for their distribution.</p>

<p>Per definition, we have $$F(t)=\mathbb{P}(X_i\leq t).$$ Hence $$F(X_{(i)})=\mathbb{P}(X_i\leq X_{(i)}).$$ This is the probability of the event that any $X_i$ is less or equal $X_{(i)}$. By definition of order statistics, we have $$F(X_{(n)})=\mathbb{P}(X_i\leq X_{(n)})=1,$$ as $X_{(n)}$ is the maximum of the $X_i$. But how do I derive the distribution of $F(X_{(i)})$ for $i \in \{1, ..., n-1\}$?</p>

<p>I think, if they were uniformly distributed, the answer would simply be $$F(X_{(i)})=i/n.$$ But their distribution ist unknown, so I'm stuck and have no idea how to proceed from here.</p>

                                     times=3)),
                       car1 = c(100, 138, 123, 143, 112, 
                                144, 343, 112, 334), 
                       car2 = c(111, 238, 323, 541, 328, 
                                363, 411, 238, 313), 
                       car3 = c(432, 123, 322, 342, 323, 
                                522, 334, 311, 452))
</code></pre>

<p>If I wanted to generate boxplots by color (ignoring secondary grouping by ""car""), I can easily use the formula notation in <code>bwplot</code> from <code>lattice</code>.</p>

<pre><code>library(lattice)
bwplot(car1 + car2 + car3 ~ paint, data=carpaint)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/ICUVA.png"" alt=""Lattice Output""></p>

<p>However, to get a similar plot using <code>boxplot</code> from <code>graphics</code>, the formula notation is different, so I have to first convert the data to a long format and then plot, like this:</p>

<pre><code>carpaint.l = reshape(carpaint, direction=""long"", varying=2:4, sep="""")
boxplot(car ~ paint, data=carpaint.l)
</code></pre>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/zhO11.png"" alt=""Graphics Output""></p>

<p><strong>The Question</strong>: Is there a way to get the same plot with <code>boxplot</code> from <code>graphics</code> without first reshaping the data, preferably using formula notation? (This is ignoring the fact that this might not even be the type of output the OP of the linked question had wanted--they still haven't commented on my answer or the question by @RomanLuštrik. I'm just trying to satisfy my curiosity and learn to understand formula notation better.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>Note</strong>: providing alternatives is definitely welcome, but I'm hoping that any answers also help me understand why some options are working and others are not. For instance, why does <code>boxplot(as.matrix(carpaint[, 2:4]) ~ carpaint$paint)</code> work but <code>boxplot(carpaint[, 2:4] ~ carpaint$paint)</code> does not. I find that strange because the documentation for <code>boxplot</code> has examples where they convert matrices to data frames before plotting even though it does not seem to be necessary.</p>

194,Normal Bayes implementation in OpenCV,"<p>I'm a newbie to Machine Learning. I have a question about how Normal Bayes is implemented in OpenCV. </p>

<p>This <a href=""http://www.emgu.com/wiki/index.php/Normal_Bayes_Classifier_in_CSharp"" rel=""nofollow"">site</a> tells that <strong>Normal Bayes</strong> and <strong>Naive Bayes</strong> mean the same.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://opencv.itseez.com/modules/ml/doc/normal_bayes_classifier.html"" rel=""nofollow"">NormalBayes</a> documentation on <strong>OpenCV website</strong> specifies that the features are Normally distributed and not necessarily independent.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier"" rel=""nofollow"">wikipedia</a> article on Naive Bayes classifier tells us that it is assumed that features are independent. Therefore, <strong>Covariance Matrix</strong> need not be determined. </p>

<p>However, when I look at the source of the implementation of Normal Bayes classifier, it <strong>does calculate</strong> Covariance Matrix.</p>

<p>I also found a similar question over <a href=""http://old.nabble.com/Normal-Bayes-Implementation--td33253038.html"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> which wasn't answered.</p>

200,"In R, how to do nonlinear least square optimization which involves solving differential equations?","<h1>Update with reproducible examples to illustrate my problem</h1>

<p>My original question was ""Implementation of trust-region-reflective optimization algorithm in R"". However, on the way of producing a reproducible example(thanks @Ben for his advice), I realize that my problem is that in Matlab, one function <code>lsqnonlin</code> is good(meaning no need to choose a good starting value, fast) enough for most cases I have, while in R, there is not such a one-for-all function. Different optmization algorithm works well in different cases. Different algorithms reach different solutions. The reason behind this may not be that the optimization algorithms in R is inferior to the trust-region-reflective algorithm in Matlab, it could also be related to how R handles Automatic Differentiation. This problem comes actually from interrupted work two years ago. At that time, Prof. John C Nash, one of the authors of the package <strong>optimx</strong> has suggested that there has been quite a lot of work for Matlab for Automatic Differentiation, which might be the reason that the Matlab lsqnonlin performs better than the optimization functions/algorithms in R. I am not able to figure it out with my knowledge. </p>

<p>The example below shows some problems I have encountered(More reproducible examples are coming). To run the examples, first run <code>install_github(""KineticEval"",""zhenglei-gao"")</code>. You need to install package <strong>mkin</strong> and its dependencies and may also need to install a bunch of other packages for different optimization algorithms.</p>

<p>Basically I am trying to solve nonlinear least-squares curve fitting problems as described in the Matlab function <code>lsqnonlin</code> 's documentation (<a href=""http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/optim/ug/lsqnonlin.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mathworks.de/de/help/optim/ug/lsqnonlin.html</a>). The curves in my case are modeled by a set of differential equations. I will explain a bit more with the examples. Optimization algorithms I have tried including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Marq from <code>nls.lm</code>, the Levenburg-Marquardt</li>
<li>Port from <code>nlm.inb</code></li>
<li>L-BGFS-B from <code>optim</code></li>
<li>spg from <code>optimx</code></li>
<li><code>solnp</code> of package <strong>Rsolnp</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>I have also tried a few others but did not show here. </p>

<h2>A summary of my questions</h2>

<ul>
<li>Is there in R a reliable function/algorithm to use, like <code>lsqnonlin</code> in Matlab that can solve my type of nonlinear least square problems? (I could not find one.)</li>
<li>What is the reason that for a simple case, different optimization reach different solutions?</li>
<li>What makes <code>lsqnonlin</code> superior to the functions in R? The trust-region-reflective algorithm or other reasons?</li>
<li>Are there better ways to solve my type of problems, formulate differently? Maybe there is a much simple solution but I just don't know it. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Example 1: A simple case</h2>

<p>I will give the R codes first and explain later.

<p>Except for ""Marq"" and ""solnp"", the other algorithms did not reach the optimum.Besides, 'spg' method (also other methods like 'bobyqa') need too many function evaluations for such a simple case . Moreover, if I change the starting value and make <code>k_Parent=0.0058</code> (the optimum value for that parameter) instead of the random choosen <code>0.1</code>,  ""Marq"" cannot find the optimum any more! (Code provided below). I have also had datasets where ""solnp"" does not find the optimum. However, if I use <code>lsqnonlin</code> in Matlab, I haven't encountered any difficulties for such simple cases. </p>

<p>I will explain what I am optimising here. If you have run the above script and see the curves, we use a two-compartment model with first order reactions to describe the curves. The differential equations to express the model are in <code>ex1$diffs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>                                                             Parent 
                                    ""d_Parent = - k_Parent * Parent"" 
                                                               Metab 
""d_Metab = - k_Metab * Metab + k_Parent * f_Parent_to_Metab * Parent"" 
</code></pre>

<p>For this simple case, from the differential equations we can derive the equations to describe the two curves. The to be optimized parameters are <code>$M_0,k_p, k_m, c=\mbox{FF_parent_to_Met} $</code> with the constraints <code>$M_0&gt;0,k_p&gt;0, k_m&gt;0, 1&gt; c &gt;0$</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$$
\begin{split}
            y_{1j}&amp;= M_0e^{-k_pt_i}+\epsilon_{1j}\\
            y_{2j} &amp;= cM_0k_p\frac{e^{-k_mt_i}-e^{-k_pt_i}}{k_p-k_m}+\epsilon_{2j}
            \end{split}
$$
</code></pre>

<p>Therefore we can fit the curve without solving differential equations. </p>

<h1>The original question</h1>

<p>Many of the methods used in Matlab Optimization Toolbox solvers are based on trust regions. According to the CRAN Task View page, only packages <strong>trust</strong>, <strong>trustOptim</strong>, <strong>minqa</strong>  have the trust-region based methods implemented. However, <code>trust</code> and <code>trustOptim</code> require gradient and hessian. <code>bobyqa</code> in <strong>minqa</strong> seems not the one I am looking for. From my personal experience, the trust-region-reflective algorithm in Matlab often performs better compared to the algorithms I tried in R. So I tried to find a similar implemetation of this algorithm in R.</p>

<p>I have asked a related question here: <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13703344/is-there-an-r-function-using-the-same-algorithm-implemented-in-the-lsqnonlin-f"">R function to search for a function</a></p>

<p>The answer Matthew Plourde provided gives a function <code>lsqnonlin</code> with the same function name in Matlab but does not have the trust-region-reflective algorithm implemented. I edited the old one and asked a new question here because I think Matthew Plourde's answer is in general very helpful to R users who are looking for a function.</p>

<p>I did a search again and have no luck. Are there still some functions/packages out there which implement similar matlab functions. If not, I wonder if it is allowed that I tranlate the Matlab function directly into R and use it for my own purpose. </p>

203,Calculating modelview matrix for 2D camera using Eigen,"<p>I'm trying to calculate modelview matrix of my 2D camera but I can't get the formula right. I use the Affine3f transform class so the matrix is compatible with OpenGL. This is closest that I did get by trial and error. This code rotates and scales the camera ok, but if I apply translation and rotation at same time the camera movement gets messed up: camera moves in rotated fashion, which is not what I want. (And this probaly due to fact I first apply the rotation matrix and then translation)</p>

<pre><code>Eigen::Affine3f modelview;
modelview.setIdentity();
modelview.translate(Eigen::Vector3f(camera_offset_x, camera_offset_y, 0.0f));
modelview.scale(Eigen::Vector3f(camera_zoom_x, camera_zoom_y, 0.0f));
modelview.rotate(Eigen::AngleAxisf(camera_angle, Eigen::Vector3f::UnitZ()));
modelview.translate(Eigen::Vector3f(camera_x, camera_y, 0.0f));
[loadmatrix_to_gl]
</code></pre>

<p>What I want is that camera would rotate and scale around offset position in screenspace {(0,0) is middle of the screen in this case} and then be positioned along the global xy-axes in worldspace {(0,0) is also initialy at middle of the screen} to the final position. How would I do this?</p>

<p>Note that I have set up also an orthographic projection matrix, which may affect this problem.</p>

<p>I let $Z = \frac{Y-E(Y)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(Y)}}$.
Differentiating the MGF of $Y$ and let $t = 0$ we have $$E(Y) = s,$$$$E(Y^2) = s^2 +2s,$$$$\operatorname{Var}(Y) = 2s.$$
Thus Mgf of Z:
 \begin{align*}E(\exp(tz)) &amp;= E\left(\exp\left(\frac{t(y-s)}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\right)\\
&amp;=E\left(\exp\left(\frac{ty}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\exp\left(\frac{-ts}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\right)\\
&amp;=E\left(\exp\left(\frac{ty}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\exp\left(\frac{-ts}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\right)\\
&amp;=\exp\left(\frac{-ts}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\frac{1}{\left(2-\exp\left(\frac{t}{\sqrt{2s}}\right)\right)^s}.

<p>What I want to do is find a value in the val column having the same cat that lies closest to either the LWR or UPP values.  It's probably easiest to understand by looking at the desired output:</p>

<pre><code>  cat id val LWR  UPP  LS NLWR  US NUPP
1   A s1 150 100  200  s4  104 s11  199

<p>The new coloums (LS and NLWR/US and NUPP) are the same as the ids and vals from the extracted rows, just given new column names.  I've tried to run this using various forms of ""which"" and then reforming the data but haven't had any luck.  Is there a direct way to do this, or will it always take multiple steps?</p>

219,Calculating the value of a unit in a game,"<p>I'm currently working on a game where each unit has a value for health, shields and agility as well as a certain number of six types of weapon. </p>

<p>e.g. Unit B has 2 lasers, 2 heavy lasers, and 1 missile launcher, no ion blaster, no heavy ion blaster, no nuclear missiles, 5 health, 2 shield, and 40 agility. </p>

<p>I have gone through a good 20 different algorithms trying to get MS Excel to balance these all these factors to give the ship a score. My current algorithm works great for some of the smaller units, but gets very unbalanced with the bigger units</p>

<p>Each ship has a damage value, where each type of weaponry is multiplied by the damage of that weapon and added together.</p>

<pre><code>damage = weapon1*damage1 + weapon2*damage2 + ...
</code></pre>

<p>The damage value is multiplied by health + 2*shield + 2*agility. Agility and shield are multiplied to give them weight over health (a unit cant lose health if it can't be hit). I also subtract the cost of the unit. So my current equation for one of my units looks like:</p>

<pre><code>value = damage*(health + 2*shield + 2*agility) - 3*cost

<p>Here are some examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>Unit 1 - 1 laser, 1 health, 93 agility, and costs 1. Total score is 233.</li>
<li>Unit 2 - 2 lasers, a missile launcher, and 3 health, but only 76 agility. Score is 200. </li>
<li>Unit 3 - 6 lasers, 30 health and 15 shields, 37 agility - scores 585. </li>

231,How to write an intersects for Shapes in android,"<p>I have an written an Object called Shape which has a Point representing the topLeftCorner and a Dimension with represents its width and height. 
To get the topRightCorner I can simply add the width to the topLeftPoint.x. I use to rotate them on a certain degree around their center. The problem after the rotation is, that my <code>intersects(Shape)</code> method fails, because it does not honor the rotation of the Shapes. The rotation will be the same for each Shape. My current implementation looks like this inside my Shape Object:</p>

<pre><code>public boolean intersects(Shape s){
    // functions returning a Point of shape s
    return intersects(s.topLeft())
        || intersects(s.topRight())
        || intersects(s.bottomLeft())
        || intersects(s.bottomRight())
        || intersects(s.leftCenter())
        || intersects(s.rightCenter())
        || intersects(s.center());
}

public boolean intersects(Point p){
    return p.x &gt;= leftX()
        &amp;&amp; p.x &lt;= rightX()
        &amp;&amp; p.y &gt;= topY()
        &amp;&amp; p.y &lt;= bottomY();

<p>But I really want to do this with GGPLOT2 because I want to add other features that are only available with GGPLOT2. It seems that GGPLOT really wants to take my empirical data and calculate the density for me. And it gives me a bunch of lip because my data sets are of different lengths. So how do I get these three densities to plot in GGPLOT2?</p>

<p>It will probably be easier if you see it for yourself. Here's the javascript:</p>

<pre><code>var mouseX=0;

function loop() {
    // Clear Screen
    context.clearRect(0,0,canvas.width,canvas.height);

    // Calculate the angle to the mouse
    a = Math.atan2(mouseX-canvas.width/2,mouseY-canvas.height/2);

    // Draw a line in the direction of the mouse
    context.beginPath();
    context.fillStyle = ""#000000"";
    context.moveTo(canvas.width/2+10, canvas.height/2);
    context.lineTo(canvas.width/2-10, canvas.height/2);
    context.lineTo(canvas.width/2+Math.cos(a)*100, canvas.height/2+Math.sin(a)*100);

document.addEventListener('mousemove', mouseMoveHandler, false);
window.addEventListener('resize', windowResizeHandler, false);
windowResizeHandler();

237,R: serialize objects to text file and back again,"<p>I have a process in R that creates a bunch of objects, serializes them, and puts them into plain text files. This seemed like a really good way to handle things since I am working with Hadoop and all output needs to stream through stdin and stdout. </p>

<p>The problem I am left with is how to read these objects out of the text file and back into R on my desktop machine. Here's a working example that illustrates the challenge:</p>

<p>Let's create a tmp file and write a single object into it. This object is just a vector:</p>

<pre><code>outCon &lt;- file(""c:/tmp"", ""w"")
mychars &lt;- rawToChar(serialize(1:10, NULL, ascii=T))
cat(mychars, file=outCon)
close(outCon)
</code></pre>

<p>The mychars object looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; mychars
[1] ""A\n2\n133633\n131840\n13\n10\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n""
</code></pre>

<p>when written to the text file it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>A
2
133633
131840
13
10
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
</code></pre>

<p>I'm probably overlooking something terribly obvious, but how do I read this file back into R and unserialize the object? When I try scan() or readLines() both want to treat the new line characters as record delimiters and I end up with a vector where each element is a row from the text file. What I really want is a text string with the whole contents of the file. Then I can unserialize the string. </p>

<p>Perl will read line breaks back into a string, but I can't figure out how to override the way R treats line breaks. </p>

238,"creating rectangular mesh (list of line segments) from a 2D array of points, in numpy","<p>I have an MxNx2 array of 2D points, where each point represents the center of a measured property of a grid. The graphical representation is below, with white points being the positions:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/Y6RjU.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>The point structure is like this (shape: MxNx2):</p>

<pre><code>[[[xij, yij], [xij, yij], ...]],
 [[xij, yij], [xij, yij], ...]],
 [[xij, yij], [xij, yij], ...]],
 [ ..., ...., ............... ],
 [[xij, yij], [xij, yij], ...]]]

<p>The desired output would be like this:</p>

<pre><code>[[[x1, x2], [y1, y2]],
 [[x1, x2], [y1, y2]],
 ....................,
 [[x1, x2], [y1, y2]]
</code></pre>

<p>So that I could plot every segment one by one (using each pair of x,y positions) like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/FmPnC.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>I have trying something similar to:</p>

<pre><code>segments = []

    for col in xrange(a.shape[1] - 1):
        here = a[row, col]
        below = a[row+1, col]
        right = a[row, col+1]
        segments.extend(((here, right), (here, below)))
</code></pre>

<p>but that leaves the right and bottom edges uncovered. Also, I suspect this is a somewhat ""dumb"", non-vectorized, brute-force way of doing it, it seems to be a common enough problem to have perhaps a mesh-creating function for it.</p>

<p>Any suggestion is welcome!</p>

245,Is the death penalty an effective deterrent?,"<p>There is a lot of clutter from anti-death penalty sites, which makes it hard to find all the research.  They often cite statistics like those explained in <a href=""http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/deterrence-states-without-death-penalty-have-had-consistently-lower-murder-rates"" rel=""nofollow"">this website</a>, including the chart below that shows that murder rates in states without the death penalty are lower than those in states with the death penalty.</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/dt5r7.jpg"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>Is a straight comparison of murder rates a fair way to gauge the effectiveness of the death penalty as a deterrent?  Might the murder rates be even higher in states that currently have the death penalty if they abandoned the practice?  Aren't there likely to be other factors that are contributing to higher murder rates (such as what each state considers to be ""murder"", or poverty levels, especially in the typically poorer southern states that carry out the majority of executions in the US)?  Is there any evidence for death penalty effectiveness that attempts to control for these other variables?  What about as a deterrent for other crimes besides murder?</p>

<p>Unless you're on here from China or Iran, I imagine this is a pretty uniquely US question. However, many European countries currently without the death penalty once had such laws, and perhaps the arguments used in those older debates would have merit.</p>

<p>UPDATE: I think ideally the answer to this question should involve some crime statistics from a place that had the death penalty, and then abolished it, or vice versa.  Ideally modeled in a way to try and control for other factors (as much as possible).</p>

257,Google Combinatorial Optimization interview problem‍​​,"<p>I got asked this question on a interview for google a couple of weeks ago, I didn't quite get the answer and I was wondering if anyone here could help me out.</p>

<p>You have an array with <strong>n</strong> elements. The elements are either 0 or 1.
You want to <strong>split the array into k <em>contiguous</em> subarrays</strong>. The size of each subarray can vary between ceil(n/2k) and floor(3n/2k). You can assume that k &lt;&lt; n.
After you split the array into k subarrays. One element of each subarray will be randomly selected. </p>

<p>Devise an algorithm for maximizing the sum of the randomly selected elements from the k subarrays.
Basically means that we will want to split the array in such way such that the sum of all the expected values for the elements selected from each subarray is maximum. </p>

<p>You can assume that n is a power of 2.</p>

<pre><code>Example:

Array: [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,0,1,1,0]
n = 12
k = 3
Size of subarrays can be: 2,3,4,5,6

Possible subarrays [0,0,1] [1,0,0,1] [1,0,1,1,0]
Expected Value of the sum of the elements randomly selected from the subarrays: 1/3 + 2/4 + 3/5 = 43/30 ~ 1.4333333 

Optimal split: [0,0,1,1,0,0][1,1][0,1,1,0]
Expected value of optimal split: 1/3 + 1 + 1/2 = 11/6 ~ 1.83333333

261,What's the correct terminology for something that isn't quite classification nor regression?,"<p>Let's say that I have a problem that is basicly classification. That is, given some input and a number of possible output classes, find the correct class for the given input. Neural networks and decision trees are some of the algorithms that may be used to solve such problems. These algorithms typically only emit a single result however: the resulting classification.</p>

<p>Now what if I weren't only interested in one classification, but in the <em>posterior probabilities</em> that the input belongs to each of the classes. I.E., instead of the answer ""This input belongs in class A"", I want the answer ""This input belongs to class A with 80%, class B with 15% and class C with 5%"".</p>

<p>My question is not on how to obtain these posterior probabilities, but rather on the correct terminology to describe the process of finding them. You could call it regression, since we are now trying to estimate a number of real valued numbers, but I am not quite sure if that's right. I feel it's not exactly classification either, it's something in between the two.</p>

<p><strong>Is there a word that describes the process of finding the class conditional posterior probabilities that some input belongs in each of the possible output classes?</strong></p>

<p>P.S. I'm not exactly sure if this question is enough of a programming question, but since it's about machine learning and machine learning generally involves a decent amount of programming, let's give it a shot.</p>

<li>Basic file I/O</li>
<li>Basic matrix operations in numpy (dot product with large float matrices)</li>
</ul>

<p>Similar questions have appeared for older versions of Python 3 (3.1, 3.2) and have generally said performance was better (if only slightly) in 2.7, but based on <a href=""http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2012-October/121923.html"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""this mailing list"">this e-mail from the Python-dev mailing list</a>, it looks like Python 3.3 may now be superior 2.7.</p>

270,Reverse Bivariate Interpolation,"<p>I am given a table, indexed on 2 dimensions (x,y), with values(not necessarily ordered, though I think it isn't a horrendously unsafe assumption) z given, such that f(x, y) = z</p>

<p>So given an x and y, I interpolate to find a z value. Now given an x value(or y I suppose, not really important) and a z value, I need to find that y value that corresponds to the data. Is it possible to do this without the knowledge of an ordering in the z values of the table? If there is an ordering to the z values of the table is it possible? In my head, given ordering, it should be possible to find a unique solution, but I don't know how I can do it if I am not given ordering.</p>
"
271,Prolog parse postfix math expressions,"<p>I solved this my self. I'll post the solution when were past due date for my homework. </p>

<p>Okay, I'm going to build a parser or an evaluator. The de facto standard when parsing with prefix notation is to just use a stack. Add to the stack if input is a number, if it is an operator you can pop twice apply operator and put the result back on the stack. </p>

<p>The stack here would be a list, so I need to know how I can apply the operators. The input would be a string. ""(11+2*)"" This would 1+1=2*2=4. First it would read 1, and 1 to the stack. Read another 1 and add it to the stack. Now it reads ""+"", so it removes(pop) twice from the stack and apply + and puts the result back. Read 2, put 2 on the stack. Read *, pop twice and apply *. </p>

<p>Hope this makes sense. How would the predicate look like? I need one variable for the input string, one to maintain the stack, and one for the result? Three? </p>

<p>I'm especially wondering about push and pop on the stack as well as removing as I go from the input string. </p>

272,R finding duplicates in one column and collapsing in a second column,"<p>I have a data frame with two columns contacting character strings. in one column (named <code>probes</code>)  I have duplicated cases (that is, several cases with the same character string).  for each case in probes I want to find all the cases containing the same string, and then merge the values of all the corresponding cases in the second column (named <code>genes</code>) into a single case.
for example, if I have this structure:</p>

<pre><code>    probes  genes
1   cg00050873  TSPY4
2   cg00061679  DAZ1
3   cg00061679  DAZ4
4   cg00061679  DAZ4

<p>I want to change it to this structure:</p>

<pre><code>    probes  genes
1   cg00050873  TSPY4
2   cg00061679  DAZ1 DAZ4 DAZ4
</code></pre>

<p>obviously there is no problem doing this for a single probe using which, and then paste and collapse</p>

<pre><code>ind&lt;-which(olap$probes==""cg00061679"")
genename&lt;-(olap[ind,2])
genecomb&lt;-paste(genename[1:length(genename)], collapse="" "")

"
273,inverse of a cdf,"<p>I would like to compute the inverse cumulative density function (inverse cdf) of a given pdf. The pdf is directly given as a histogram, ie., a vector of N equally spaced components.</p>

<p>My current approach is to do :</p>

<pre><code>cdf = cumsum(pdf);
K = 3;   %// some upsampling factor
maxVal = 1;   %// just for my own usage - a scaling factor
M = length(cdf);
N = M*K;   %// increase resolution for higher accuracy
y = zeros(N, 1);
cursor = 2;
for i=1:N
   desiredF = (i-1)/(N-1)*maxVal;
   while (cursor&lt;M &amp;&amp; cdf(cursor)&lt;desiredF)
    cursor = cursor+1;
   end;    

   if (cdf(cursor)==cdf(cursor-1))
       y(i) = cursor-1;
   else        
       alpha = min(1, max(0,(desiredF - cdf(cursor-1))/(cdf(cursor)-cdf(cursor-1))));
       y(i) = ((cursor-1)*(1-alpha) + alpha*cursor )/maxVal;
   end;

end;

y = resample(y, 1, K, 0);
</code></pre>

<p>which means that I upsample with linear interpolation, inverse and downsample my histogram. This is rather an ugly code, is not very robust (if I change the upsampling factor, I can get really different results), and is uselessly slow... could anyone suggest a better approach ?</p>

<p>Note : the generalized inverse I am trying to compute (in the case the cdf is not invertible) is :   </p>

<pre><code>F^{-1}(t) = \inf{x \in R ; F(x)&gt;t }   
</code></pre>

<p>with F the cumulative density function</p>

<p>[EDIT : actually, K = 1 (ie., no upsampling) seems to give more accurate results...]</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

281,learning maths for statistics,"<p>Apologies if I have posted this in the wrong place first off. </p>

<p>My work has taken me into a unexpectantly large amount of statistics. In order to really understand what I am doing I need to understand these statistical approaches. However it seems almost impossible to do that unless you speak math (I don't as I'm sure you can tell). </p>

<p>So my question is are there any free online resources for learning/ getting familiar with terminology, symbols, concepts commonly used in maths/statistics that are aimed at people with basic math skills (basic algebra is okay, can barely remember how to differentiate).</p>

<p>Thanks in advance,
Cheers,
Davy</p>

<p>Edit to say:<br>
I should mention that I am somewhat (not very) familiar with basic concepts like variance, hypothesis testing, and regression, but only on a practical level. I want understand these on the mathematical level on which they were built. Method development is something I am interested in, but I'll never be able to do, If I don't start learning more mathematics. MY problem thus far seem that every book on statistics assume you don't want to see any maths at all, or your totally familiar with giant equations, which are therefore, not explained well to someone who has no idea what (probably) commonplace symbols mean. I guess what I am really looking for is an induction to the domain specific language of maths, with a view towards stats.</p>

water jug problem (<strong>with two jugs)</strong> which is summed as thus:</p>

<p>Using the property of the G.C.D of two numbers that GCD(a,b) is the smallest possible linear combination of a and b, and hence a certain quantity Q is only measurable by the 2 jugs, iff Q is a n*GCD(a,b), since Q=sA + tB, where:</p>

A = capacity of jug A
B=  capacity of jug B

299,numpy read CSV file where some fields have commas?,"<p>I'm trying to read a CSV file using <code>numpy.recfromcsv(...)</code> where some of the fields have commas in them. The fields that have commas in them are surrounded by quotes i.e., <code>""value1, value2""</code>. Numpy see's the quoted field as two different fields and it doesn't work very well. The command I'm using right now is</p>

<pre><code>    data = numpy.recfromcsv(dataFilename, delimiter=',', autstrip=True)
</code></pre>

<p>I found this question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8311900/python-read-csv-file-with-comma-within-fields"">Python: read CSV file with comma within fields</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But it doesn't use <code>numpy</code>, which I'd really love to use.
So I'm hoping there are at least one of a few options here:</p>

<ol>
<li>What are some options to <code>numpy.recfromcsv(...)</code> that will allow me to read a quoted field as one field instead of multiple comma separated fields?</li>
<li>Should I format my CSV file differently?</li>
<li>(alternatively, but not ideally) Read CSV as in quoted question, with extra steps to create <code>numpy</code> array.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please advise.</p>

302,Exposing C++ class with Rcpp,"<p>I've been playing around with Rcpp and a couple of questions are currently popping up...</p>

<p>From my understanding, if you want to expose a C++ class to R you need to write partial template specializations for Rcpp::wrap and Rcpp::as. I looked how this was done in the Rcpp::Date class and I have the following questions:
- In Date.h we have:</p>

<pre><code>// template specialisation for wrap() on the date
// OK as explained in docs for non intrusive 
// partial template specialization
template &lt;&gt; SEXP wrap&lt;Rcpp::Date&gt;(const Rcpp::Date &amp;date);
</code></pre>

<p>Further down the header you have the following code:</p>

<pre><code>template&lt;&gt; inline SEXP wrap_extra_steps&lt;Rcpp::Date&gt;( SEXP x ){
Rf_setAttrib( x, R_ClassSymbol, Rf_mkString( ""Date"" ) ) ;
return x ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>What is the wrap_extra_steps supposed to do? Is it required? Also in Date.cpp wrap method is implemented as follows:</p>

<pre><code>template &lt;&gt; SEXP wrap(const Date &amp;date) {
   return internal::new_date_object( date.getDate() ) ;
}
</code></pre>

<p>With the internal::new_date_object implemented as:</p>

<pre><code>SEXP new_date_object( double d){
   SEXP x = PROTECT(Rf_ScalarReal( d ) ) ;
   Rf_setAttrib(x, R_ClassSymbol, Rf_mkString(""Date""));
   UNPROTECT(1);
   return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p>OK I understand that an SEXP is created and returned to R, but I don't get the whole part with PROTECT(), Rf_setAttrib, UNPROTECT...what's happening here?</p>

<p>Thanks!     </p>

<li><p>How can I get the labels to be centered below the groups of bars? I tried to come up with some arithmetic calculations to position the xlabels in the right place (see code above) but it's still slightly off... it feels a bit like writing a plotting library rather than using one. How can this be fixed? (Is there a wrapper or built in utility for matplotlib where this is default behavior?)</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Reply to @mlgill: thank you for your answer. Your code is certainly much more elegant but still has the same issue, namely that the width of the bars and the spacing between the groups are not controlled separately. Your graph looks correct but the bars are far too wide -- it looks like an Excel graph -- and I wanted to make the bar thinner.</p>

<p>Width and margin are now linked, so if I try:</p>

<pre><code>margin = 0.60
width = (1.-2.*margin)/num_items
</code></pre>

<p>It makes the bar skinnier, but brings the group far apart, so the plot again does not look right.</p>

<p>How can I make a grouped bar plot function that takes two parameters: the width of each bar, and the spacing between the bar groups, and plots it correctly like your code did, i.e. with the x-axis labels centered below the groups?</p>

<p>I think that since the user has to compute specific low-level layout quantities like margin and width, we are still basically writing a plotting library :) </p>

325,A question about statistics...,"<blockquote>
  <p>Let X1, X2, …, Xn be a random sample from a Poisson(λ) distribution. Let (X-bar) be their sample mean and $S2$ their sample variance. 
  a) Show that $\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{\sqrt{\bar{X}}}$ and $\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{S}$ both have a standard normal limiting distribution. 
  b) Find the limiting distribution of $\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]^2$<br>
  c) Find the limiting distribution of $\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}^2-\lambda^2]$</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a) For $\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{S}$, we know that $\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{S}$ = $(\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{\sigma})(\frac{\sigma}{S})$. Since 
$\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{\sigma}$ appraches N(0,1) in distribution by CLT, and since $(\frac{\sigma}{S})$ appraches 1 in probability, the whole thing approaches N(0,1).</p>

<p>For 
$\frac{\sqrt{n}[\bar{X}-\lambda]}{\sqrt{\bar{X}}}$, we get the same result...since the mean is equal to the variance in a poisson distribution.</p>

<p>b) I'm a little confused about this one...</p>

<p>c) From a theorem in my textbook, I know that if $\sqrt{n}(X_n - \theta) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2)$ and if there is a differentiable function g(x) at theta where the derivative at theta is not zero...then $\sqrt{n}(g(X_n)-g(\theta)) \rightarrow N(0,\sigma^2(g'(\theta))^2)$.</p>

<p>So I just need to use this theorem, right? And in this case g(x)=x^2. </p>

<p>Do you think my answer for a), and c) are correct? Also, can you give me a hint for b)?</p>

339,First bracketed assignment is as time-consuming as full assignment?,"<p>Regarding this answer in:
<a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15759117/what-exactly-is-copy-on-modify-semantics-in-r-and-where-is-the-canonical-source/16370240#16370240"">What exactly is copy-on-modify semantics in R, and where is the canonical source?</a></p>

<p>We can see that, at the first time a vector is altered with <code>'[&lt;-'</code>, R copies the entire vector even if only a single entry is to be modifed. At the second time, however, the vector is altered ""in place"". This is noticeable without inspecting the address of the objects if we measure the time to create and modify a large vector:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; system.time(a &lt;- rep(1L, 10^8))
   user  system elapsed 
   0.15    0.17    0.31 
&gt; system.time(a[222L] &lt;- 111L)
   user  system elapsed 
   0.26    0.08    0.34 
&gt; system.time(a[333L] &lt;- 111L)
   user  system elapsed 
      0       0       0
</code></pre>

<p>Note that there is no change of type/storage.mode.</p>

<p>So the question is: why is it not possible to optimize the first bracket assignment as well? In what situation this kind of behaviour (full copy at first modification) is actually needed?</p>

<p>EDIT: (spoiler!) As explained in the accepted answer below, this is nothing but an artifact of enclosing the first assignment in a <code>system.time</code> function call. This causes R to mark the memory space bound to <code>a</code> as possibly referring to more than one symbol, thus requiring duplication when changed. If we remove the enclosing calls, the vector is modified in place from the very first bracket assignment.</p>

342,How do you calculate cyclomatic complexity for R functions?,"<p><a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Cyclomatic_complexity"" rel=""nofollow"">Cyclomatic complexity</a> measures how many possible branches can be taken through a function.  Is there an existing function/tool to calculate it for R functions?  If not, suggestions are appreciated for the best way to write one.</p>

<p>A cheap start towards this would be to count up all the occurences of <code>if</code>, <code>ifelse</code> or <code>switch</code> within your function.  To get a real answer though, you need to understand when branches start and end, which is much harder.  Maybe some R parsing tools would get us started?</p>

343,Why does C++ define the norm as the euclidean norm squared,"<p>This may sound like a bit of a rhetorical question, but I ask it here for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>It took me a while to figure out what C++ std::norm() was doing differently from Matlab/Octave, so others may stumble upon it here.</li>
<li>I find it odd to define the <code>norm()</code> function as being something different (though closely related) to what is generally considered to be the norm (or L2-norm, or euclidean norm, etc. etc.)</li>
</ol>

<p>Specifically the C++ standard library defines <code>norm()</code> for complex numbers to be the square of the modulus (or absolute value), where the modulus is sqrt(a^2 + b^2) when the complex number is in the form a + i*b.</p>

<p>This goes against my understanding of the norm, which when specified as the euclidean norm (which corresponds to the modulus used here), is the square root of the sum of squares. I'll reference <a href=""http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ComplexModulus.html"" rel=""nofollow"">Mathworld's definition of the complex modulus</a>.</p>

<p>Is this something others have run into? I found it as a result of porting some signal processing code from Octave to C++, and the only other place I found reference to this difference was on the GCC mailing list (can't post the link due to 1-link limit).</p>

350,How to save dictionaries and arrays in the same archive (with numpy.savez),"<p>first question here. I'll try to be concise.</p>

<p>I am generating multiple arrays containing feature information for a machine learning application. As the arrays do not have equal dimensions, I store them in a dictionary rather than in an array. There are two different kinds of features, so I am using two different dictionaries.</p>

<p>I also generate labels to go with the features. These labels are stored in arrays. Additionally, there are strings containing the exact parameters used for running the script and a timestamp. </p>

<p>All in all it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>import numpy as np    

feature1 = {}
feature2 = {}
label1 = np.array([])
label2 = np.array([])
docString = 'Commands passed to the script were...'

# features look like this:
feature1 = {'case 1': np.array([1, 2, 3, ...]),
            'case 2': np.array([2, 1, 3, ...]),
            'case 3': np.array([2, 3, 1, ...]),
            and so on... }
</code></pre>

<p>Now my goal would be to do this:</p>

<pre><code>np.savez(outputFile, 
         saveFeature1 = feature1, 
         saveFeature2 = feature2, 
         saveLabel1 = label1, 
         saveLabel2 = label2,
         saveString = docString)
</code></pre>

<p>This seemingly works (i.e. such a file is saved with no error thrown and can be loaded again). However, when I try to load for example the feature from the file again:</p>

<pre><code>loadedArchive = np.load(outFile)
loadedFeature1 = loadedArchive['saveFeature1']
loadedString = loadedArchive['saveString']
</code></pre>

<p>Then instead of getting a dictionary back, I get a numpy array of shape (0) where I don't know how to access the contents:</p>

<pre><code>In []: loadedFeature1
Out[]: 
       array({'case 1': array([1, 2, 3, ...]), 
              'case 2': array([2, 3, 1, ...]), 
              ..., }, dtype=object)
</code></pre>

<p>Also strings become arrays and get a strange datatype:</p>

<pre><code>In []: loadedString.dtype
Out[]: dtype('|S20')
</code></pre>

<p>So in short, I am assuming this is not how it is done correctly. However I would prefer not to put all variables into one big dictionary because I will retrieve them in another process and would like to just loop over the dictionary.keys() without worrying about string comparison.</p>

<p>Any ideas are greatly appreciated.
Thanks</p>

352,What command converts knitr R Markdown into Stack-Exchange-friendly Markdown?,"<p><strong>Motivation</strong>:
I often want to paste the results of a quick analysis using R Markdown into a StackExchange site. This includes the <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r"">R-tag on Stack Overflow</a>, <a href=""http://stats.stackexchange.com/"">Cross Validated</a>, or even a domain specific analysis on sites like <a href=""http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/"">Cognitive Sciences Stack Exchange</a> (e.g., this quick analysis of <a href=""http://cogsci.stackexchange.com/questions/922/what-is-the-correlation-between-objective-indexes-and-aggregated-self-report-mea/1067#1067"">OECD life index data</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Problems with default conversion:</strong>
The <strong>default</strong> markdown output of <code>knitr</code> is not suitable for inclusion on StackExchange.
The main problems I can see are that</p>

<ul>
<li>images are referenced to the local hard drive</li>
<li>code chunks are not tab or space indented; rather they use github style Markdown (i.e., no indentation)</li>
</ul>

<p>I.e., the chunks look like this:</p>

<pre><code>```r
some code
```
</code></pre>

<p>and output looks like this</p>

<pre><code>```
## some output
## ...
```
</code></pre>

<p>There might also be other specific issues to consider, such as </p>

<ul>
<li>ensuring tables are included properly</li>
<li>ensuring that equations are passed correctly for sites that support MathJax like Cross Validated and Cognitive Science Stack Exchange.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Question</h3>

<p><strong>What is a good command for converting R Markdown into Markdown (or HTML) suitable for simple inclusion into Stack Exchange sites?</strong></p>

<p>I think an ideal command would be a one-liner that takes an R Markdown file and generates a file where the entire content can be pasted directly into Stack Exchange to yield a well-formatted question or answer.</p>

<p>I share <a href=""https://github.com/downloads/jeromyanglim/assorted-files/non-sig-r.rmd"" rel=""nofollow"">this simple rmd file</a> with a couple of code chunks, a figure, and an equation as a test example.</p>

<p><strong>Initial thoughts</strong>:
Hosting of images on imgur would presumably sort out the issue with images. This can be done by including the following in the R Markdown file, but it would probably be simpler if this instruction was incorporated into some one-liner command.</p>

<pre><code>``` {r }
opts_knit$set(upload.fun = imgur_upload) 
````
</code></pre>

<p>It might be worth considering whether HTML or Markdown is the better format for pasting into  StackExchange. The <code>markdown</code> package provides a lot of flexibility.</p>

356,Data binning: irregular polygons to regular mesh,"<p>I have thousands of polygons stored in a table format (given their 4 corner coordinates) which represent small regions of the earth. In addition, each polygon has a data value.

<pre><code>lat1,  lat2,  lat3,  lat4,  lon1,   lon2,   lon3,   lon4,   data
57.27, 57.72, 57.68, 58.1,  151.58, 152.06, 150.27, 150.72, 13.45

<p>Many of the polygons intersect or overlap. Now I would like to create a n*m matrix ranging from -90° to 90° latitude and -180° to 180° longitude in steps of, for instance, 0.25°x0.25° to store the (area-weighted) mean data value of all polygons that fall within each pixel.</p>

<p>So, one pixel in the regular mesh shall get the mean value of one or more polygons (or none if no polygon overlaps with the pixel). Each polygon should contribute to this mean value depending on its area fraction within this pixel.</p>

<p>Basically the regular mesh and the polygons look like this:</p>

<p><img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/5gUq7.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

<p>If you look at pixel 2, you see that two polygons are inside this pixel. Thus, I have to take the mean data value of both polygons considering their area fractions. The result should be then stored in the regular mesh pixel.</p>

<p>I looked around the web and found no satisfactory approach for this so far. Since I am using Python/Numpy for daily work I would like to stick to it. Is this possible? The package <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/Shapely"">shapely</a> looks promising but I don't know where to begin with...

358,Optimum pairing logic,"<p>Here's a challenge that might best suit the mathematicians..</p>

 - value is an integer 0+.
 - flag is a boolean, 0 or 1.
 - e.g. 1,0  24,1  56,0  658,1 etc..</p>

<p>The objects must be paired wherever possible, according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each pair must have at least one object with flag = 1.</li>
<li>If only one object in the pair has flag = 1, it must be the one with the highest value.</li>
<li>The ""value"" of a pair is equal to the highest value of the two objects.</li>
<li>The total sum of ""values"" of all pairs, plus the sum of values of unpaired objects, must be minimal (small as it possibly can be for any arrangement).</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, there is a direct application to this problem which is probably obvious, but I think I've stated it in the most general terms possible. </p>

<p><strong>The challenge:</strong>  Demonstrate an algorithm which assigns pairs to reach the lowest possible total sum.</p>

<p>Contributions are appreciated in either a programming language or your choice, mathematical notation, or simply a plain English / pseudo code approach.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> - the naive algorithm that I initially suggested is as simple as:</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose the highest priced, flagged, unmatched product.</li>
<li>Choose the next highest priced (or same price) unmatched, product.</li>
<li>Match those two products.</li>
<li>Repeat until 0 flagged or &lt;2 total products remain.</li>

364,Table like dotplot in R,"<p>I want to create a table like dotplot with ggplot but haven't found the right way to do it. I am using code like the following to plot p-values for different groups across a number of covariates:</p>

<pre><code>library(ggplot2) 

y &lt;- rep(c(""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""),2) 
p &lt;-  abs(rnorm(n=8)) 
group &lt;- rep(c(""1"",""2""),4)

df &lt;- data.frame(p, y, group, n) 

ggplot(data = df, mapping = aes(x = p, y= y 
    ))+ geom_point(mapping=aes(y=y, x=p), stat=""identity"")
</code></pre>

<p>I want the covariates to be on the y-axis and the p-values on the x-axis.</p>

<p>The specific problems I find are two:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>First, there are different subsets (""groups"" in this data) for each combination of y and x, as reflected in different dots located on the same rows. Therefore, I would like the p-values to be plotted on separate rows. While faceting would offer a solution, it is not what I am looking for. I want the different groups to be identified within the same facet/panel (I am also avoiding colors because I am using that for something else).</p></li>
<li><p>Second, I would like a column showing the number of observations (""n"" in this data) on the left-hand side. The end result would have three columns on the left of the graph: one with the y labels spanning over different groups, another with the groups, and the last with the number of observations.</p></li>

366,Recalculate column only for highest date in each category,"<p>I want to recalculate a column in my <code>data.table</code> only for certain rows, depending on a <code>Condition</code>, the category (<code>Cat</code>) and the <code>Date</code>.</p>

<p>A row may qualify to be recalculated only if <code>Condition==TRUE</code>. Among all rows with <code>Condition==TRUE</code>, only the rows with the highest <code>Date</code> for the respective <code>Cat</code> should be selected.</p>

<p>A simplified example:</p>

<pre><code>     DF = data.frame(Cat=rep(c(""A"",""B"",""C""),each=3), Date=rep(c(""01-08-2013"",""01-07-2013"",""01-04-2013""),3),

            Data1=c(1:9), Data2=rep(c(1:3),3), Result=c(1:1))
     DF$Date = as.Date(DF$Date , ""%m-%d-%Y"")
     DT = data.table(DF)
     DT

        Cat       Date Condition Data1 Data2 Result
     1:   A 2013-01-08      TRUE     1     1      1
     2:   A 2013-01-07      TRUE     2     2      1
     3:   A 2013-01-04     FALSE     3     3      1
     4:   B 2013-01-08     FALSE     4     1      1
     5:   B 2013-01-07     FALSE     5     2      1
     6:   B 2013-01-04     FALSE     6     3      1

     9:   C 2013-01-04      TRUE     9     3      1
</code></pre>

<p>I found out how to extract the <code>Cat</code>'s and <code>Date</code>'s of the rows, for which the <code>Result</code> must be recalculated:</p>

<pre><code>    setkey(DT, Condition, Cat, Date)
    DT[J(TRUE), max(Date), by=Cat]

       Cat         V1
    1:   A 2013-01-08
    2:   C 2013-01-04
</code></pre>

<p>However, I don't know how to calculate a new <code>Result</code> for these rows.
In this simplified example, the new <code>Result</code> should be <code>Data1+Data2</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong><br>
Inspired by eddi's answer, I came up with two more possible solutions:</p>

<p>Approach using <code>.I</code>:</p>

<pre><code>    DT[DT[Condition==TRUE , .I[which.max(Date)], by=Cat][[2]], Result:=Data1+Data2]
</code></pre>

<p>Approach using <code>.SD</code> (see eddi's note of caution):</p>

<pre><code>    max_dates=DT[Condition==TRUE , .SD[which.max(Date)], by=Cat]
    setkey(DT, Cat, Date)
    DT[max_dates, Result:=Data1 + Data2]
</code></pre>

"
367,"What discrete distribution is completely determined by its mode and variance, is easy to sample, and has nice border properties?","<p>I need to generate random ordered unranked trees that will be used to test some computer program. I'd like to incorporate some kind of control into the generation process, so that the generated trees have (in expectation) some desired properies, like: long chains (node with 1 child, its child also has 1 child, ...); or: there are many children on level 3, but not so many on level 1; or: if a node has few children, its children are more likely to have more children, but if it has many children, its children are more likely to have less; etc.</p>

<p>I've chosen this approach: define a tree as a prefix closed set of strings over some alphabet $\Sigma$ such that if $Sc$ is in the set ($S \in \Sigma^{*}$, $c \in \Sigma$), then for all $b \le c, b \in \Sigma$ $Sb$ is in the set. I fix $\Sigma$, and to generate a tree, I generate a few strings over this alphabet, treat them as nodes, and then generate all other nodes from them (by prefix closing the set, etc.)</p>

<p>The node string generation process is done symbol-by-symbol, with symbol on level $l$ generated as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Sample Bernoulli distribution with parameter $1\over d$ to see if we should stop. (That way, expected length of the generated strings is $d$.)</li>
<li>Sample symbol from the distribution $p(s | l, t) = p(s|l)p(s|t)$ where $s\in\Sigma$ is the symbol being generated, $t\in\Sigma$ is the previous generated symbol. Here, $p(s|l)$ and $p(s|t)$ are parameters of the generation process.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'd like the user of this generation process to specify discrete distribution $p(s|l)$ over symbols from $\Sigma$ for each $l$ using just two parameters: the expected symbol, and variance. (Same for $p(s|t)$ for each $t$.) The motivation is this: say, our symbols are $1,2,...,9$, then symbol $s$ at level $l$ determines the number of nodes at level $l$ under the already-generated node $S$. If we define $p(s|l)$ to be sharply distributed around $3$, in the generated trees nodes at level $l-1$ will in most cases have 3 children, and so on.</p>

<p>Now, to the question. I need a family of functions that will be my $p(s|l)$ and $p(s|t)$, with the following properties:</p>

<ol>
<li>The function is completely determined by 2 parameters, the first being its mode and the second being variance or something else that has the meaning of how sharp the values are distributed around the mean.</li>
<li>The distribution is easy to sample from. I don't want to depend on some library for that, nor write lots of complicated code. (The overall task is of low priority, but of high curiosity for me.)</li>
<li>The distribution behaves ""as expected"" if the mode is close to the beginning or end of the alphabet. Specifically, assume again that our symbols are $1,2,...,9$; if the mode is $1$, the function should be strictly decreasing, and if the mode is $5$, it should be symmetric.</li>
</ol>

<p>Beta-binomial looked similar to what I wanted, but I don't know if there is an easy way to sample from it, and also I'm not that familiar with it to come up with a good second parameter. I'd like to know if there is a simple, well-known distribution with such properties.</p>

370,Basic probability... probability that two users share a key out of a keypool of 20?,"<p>Let's say I am distributing a bunch of encryption keys, where if two users have the same key, they can communicate.  I have 20 different keys, and I am giving each user 2.  Since encryption keys don't disappear when I hand them out, it can be considered 'with replacement', but I'm not giving the same user the same key twice.  </p>

<p>I want to know what the probability that two users can communicate under these circumstances.  Doing a bit of the math from what I know, each user has 20 * 19 = 380 permutations of keys.  The order that they get the keys in doesn't matter, though, so it's actually 190 different combinations of keys.  So, two users have 190 possible combinations of four keys, and what is the probability that one of their two keys is in common.  </p>

379,Please help me on choosing right classifer,"<p>I am facing a problem on selecting correct classifier for my data-mining task.</p>

<p>I am labeling webpages using statistical method and label them using a 1-4 scale,1 being the poorest while 4 being the best.</p>

<p>Previously,I used SVM to train the system since I was using a binary(1,0) label then.But now since I switch to this 4-class label,I need to change classifier,because I think the SVM classifier will only work for two-class classification(Please correct me if I am wrong).</p>

<p>So could you please offer some suggestion here on what kind of classifier is most approriate here for my classification purpose.</p>

380,Rules-of-thumb doc for mathematical programming in R?,"<p>Does there exist a simple, cheatsheet-like document which compiles the best practices for mathematical computing in R? Does anyone have a short list of their best-practices? E.g., it would include items like:</p>

<ol>
<li>For large numerical vectors <code>x</code>, instead of computing <code>x^2</code>, one should compute <code>x*x</code>. This speeds up calculations.</li>
<li>To solve a system $Ax = b$, never solve $A^{-1}$ and left-multiply $b$. Lower order algorithms exist (e.g., Gaussian elimination)</li>
</ol>

381,summarising multiple non-exclusive dummy variables in R into one variable,"<p>I was sent a dataset with multiple dummy variables and other variables as well. Basically what I´d like to do is create summary table with summary.formula from rms. However, I do not know how to create a single variable from the multiple dummy variables and they are not mutually exclusive. Is this at all possible. Of course I could do it creating a table etc, but then I cannot use summary.formula and I´d like the summary.formula output to include just the individual levels of the dummy variables.</p>

<p>edit:
to clarify: a &amp; b need to be summarized, but they are not mutually exclusive. Since age is recorded for every row I need to summarize a &amp; b into one variable for it to be used in summary.formula. I´ve edited the code below so that 0 and 1 are changed into NA or a,b respectively.</p>

<p>I´d like the summary.formula output to be something like this:</p>

<pre><code>h&lt;-data.frame(a=sample(c(""A"",NA),100,replace=T),b=sample(c(""B"",NA),100,replace=T),age=rnorm(100,50,25),epo=sample(c(""Y"",""N""),100,T))

summary.formula(epo~age####+summary variable of a &amp; b######,method=""reverse"",data=h)

But is it possible that anybody had the same mistake and know how to deal with it?
Thanks a lot,</p>

<p>@woodchips, thank you a lot. Step by step, I've tried to do what you advised me. First of all, I actually maximized (-log(likelihood)) and this is not the problem. I think I found out the problem but I still have some questions, if I don't bother you. I have a model(param) to maximize in paramstart=p1. This model is built for (-log(likelihood(F))) and my F is a  vectorized function like F(t,Z,X,T,param,m2,m3,k,l). I have a data like (tdata,kdata,ldata),X,T are grids and Z is a function on this grid and (m1,m2,m3) are given parameters.When I want to see the value of F(tdata,Z,X,T,m1,m2,m3,kdata,ldata), I get a good output. But I think fminsearch accept that F(tdata,Z,X,T,p,m2,m3,kdata,ldata) like a constant and thatswhy I always have as estimated parameter the start value. I will be happy, if you have any advise to tweak that.</p>

"
393,Strange abline behaviour,"<p>I am currently trying to graph a time series of a price spread and then add an abline with a regression. Currently this is just a AR(1) because I wanted to get the plot right before starting.</p>

<p>The data is from a .XLS
and is organized as such in OpenOffice </p>

<pre><code>Date - Price1 - Price 2 - NA.(Empty) 
01.01.1982 - 1.56 - 2.53 -  
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>I am reading this as</p>

<pre><code>library(xlsx)
library(AER)
x&lt;-read.xlsx(""data.xlsx"",1)
</code></pre>

<p>then I fill the empty column like so</p>

<pre><code>x$NA.=(x$Price1-x$Price2)
</code></pre>

<p>So I now have a table in memory that produces this head()</p>

<pre><code>       Date Price1 Price2 NA.
1 1987-08-28  18.30  19.44 1.24
2 1987-08-31  18.65  19.75 1.12
</code></pre>

<p>(there is an index column before Date, I don't really need it since I plot by date but its there)</p>

<p>I then do</p>

<pre><code>plot(x$Date,x$NA.)
</code></pre>

<p>I get the correct plot. I have modified that plot command a bit to get correct grids, axis and dates and lines etc, but the problem I have also persists even with the simple plot version above, so the problem is not with my edits.</p>

<p>The problem is the following:</p>

<p>If I now try to plot a line</p>

<pre><code>abline(a=1,b=1,col=""blue"")
</code></pre>

<p>It doesn't work. The command goes through, but it does not show a line. However:</p>

<pre><code>abline(a=1,b=0,col=""blue"")
</code></pre>

<p>works as intended and shows a blue, horizontal line.</p>

<p>The problem I have is that I want to feed a regression object into the plot, for example like so</p>

<pre><code>SPRC=zoo(x$NA.,x$Date)
SPRC2=lag(SPRC, -1)
SPRC=SPRC[2:length(SPRC)]
LMO&lt;-lm(SPRC ~ SPRC2)
abline(a=LMO$coefficients[2],b=LMO$coefficients[1],col=""red"")
</code></pre>

<p>What I am trying to do is a simple AR to test things out. The regression works as intended, but the abline does not produce an output.</p>

<p>I also tried to do abline without variables - it works only if it b=0. I also tried instead to do a </p>

<pre><code>plot(SPRC)
</code></pre>

<p>and then any kind of abline, but either none shows up or it becomes a vertical line (!). Only if b=0 it becomes a horizontal line.</p>

<p>I imagine this has to do with the data object or input, but I am really lost on why it does not work. I also tried an as.Date on the Date object, but that does not change anything. All other plot commands seem to work, like adding custom grids, par, locator texts, axis etc. The problem occurs if I start a clean R session and pretty much only enter the code above.
I also tried to switch around the regression variables, the a and b values, or the order of the plot variables. It still does not work</p>

<p>Can you imagine what might be the issue?</p>

<p>Edit:
I just checked the datatypes if typeof().
typeof x is ""list"", everything else is ""double"", even if I do a <code>x$Date&lt;-as.Date(x$Date,""%d.%m.%Y"")</code></p>

<p>Edit2:
I went ahead and saved the file as csv and read it with read.csv
then I did</p>

<pre><code>plot(x$Price1)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>abline(a=40,b=1)
</code></pre>

<p>All it does is produce a vertical(!) line that is slightly turned clockwise.
Is my R broken?
<img src=""http://i.stack.imgur.com/OBh1j.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></p>

nexts &lt;- c(4,2,1,1,3,5,1,1,3,2,10,2,3,4,1,1,1,1,4,6)
</code></pre>

<p>What I expect to have is starting at ""starts"" 1, next tells me to move 4 places, so I end up at starts 1+4, then from starts 5 next tells me to move 3 places, now I am at starts 8, the corresponding next at position 8 is 1, I move to 9, from 9 the next move is 3...</p>

<p>The final goal would be a vector like this one goal &lt;- c(5,8,9,12....). The first vector ""starts"" might not be needed really if we can make the ""jumps"" using nexts by just reading the size of the next move at each ""landing"". like this: from 1 we jump 4, to arrive at 5, from location 5 we jump 3 to position 8 from 8 we jump 1 position to 9....</p>

400,Fastest way to cross-tabulate two massive logical vectors in R,"<p>For two logical vectors, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>, of length > 1E8, what is the fastest way to calculate the 2x2 cross tabulations?</p>

<p>I suspect the answer is to write it in C/C++, but I wonder if there is something in R that is already quite smart about this problem, as it's not uncommon.</p>

<p>Example code, for 300M entries (feel free to let N = 1E8 if 3E8 is too big; I chose a total size just under 2.5GB (2.4GB).  I targeted a density of 0.02, just to make it more interesting (one could use a sparse vector, if that helps, but type conversion can take time).</p>

<pre><code>set.seed(0)
N = 3E8
p = 0.02
x = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), N, prob = c(p, 1-p), replace = TRUE)
y = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), N, prob = c(p, 1-p), replace = TRUE)
</code></pre>

<p>Some obvious methods:</p>

<ol>
<li><code>table</code></li>
<li><code>bigtabulate</code></li>
<li>Simple logical operations (e.g. <code>sum(x &amp; y)</code>)</li>
<li>Vector multiplication (boo)</li>
<li><code>data.table</code></li>
<li>Some of the above, with <code>parallel</code> from the <code>multicore</code> package (or the new <code>parallel</code> package)</li>
</ol>

<p>I've taken a stab at the first three options (see my answer), but I feel that there must be something better and faster.</p>

<p>I find that <code>table</code> works very slowly.  <code>bigtabulate</code> seems like overkill for a pair of logical vectors.  Finally, doing the vanilla logical operations seems like a kludge, and it looks at each vector too many times (3X? 7X?), not to mention that it fills a lot of additional memory during processing, which is a massive time waster.</p>

<p>Vector multiplication is usually a bad idea, but when the vector is sparse, one may get an advantage out of storing it as such, and then using vector multiplication.</p>

<p>Feel free to vary <code>N</code> and <code>p</code>, if that will demonstrate anything interesting behavior of the tabulation functions.  :)</p>

<hr>

<p>Update 1. My first answer gives timings on three naive methods, which is the basis for believing <code>table</code> is slow.  Yet, the key thing to realize is that the ""logical"" method is grossly inefficient.  Look at what it's doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>4 logical vector operations</li>
<li>4 type conversions (logical to integer or FP - for <code>sum</code>)</li>
<li>4 vector summations</li>
<li>8 assignments (1 for the logical operation, 1 for the summation)</li>
</ul>

<p>Not only that, but it's not even compiled or parallelized.   Yet, it still beats the pants off of <code>table</code>.  Notice that <code>bigtabulate</code>, with <em>an extra type conversion</em> (<code>1 * cbind...</code>) still beats <code>table</code>.</p>

<p>Update 2.  Lest anyone point out that logical vectors in R support <code>NA</code>, and that that will be a wrench in the system for these cross tabulations (which is true in most cases), I should point out that my vectors come from <code>is.na()</code> or <code>is.finite()</code>.  :)  I've been debugging <code>NA</code> and other non-finite values - <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9167376/how-to-force-an-error-if-non-finite-values-na-nan-or-inf-are-encountered"">they've been a headache for me recently</a>.  If you don't know whether or not all of your entries are <code>NA</code>, you could test with <code>any(is.na(yourVector))</code> - this would be wise before you adopt some of the ideas arising in this Q&amp;A.</p>

<hr>

<p>Update 3. Brandon Bertelsen asked a very reasonable question in the comments: why use so much data when a sub-sample (the initial set, after all, is a sample ;-)) might be adequate for the purposes of creating a cross-tabulation?  Not to drift too far into statistics, but the data arises from cases where the <code>TRUE</code> observations are very rare, for both variables.  One is a result of a data anomaly, the other due to a possible bug in code (possible bug because we only see the computational result - think of variable <code>x</code> as ""Garbage In"", and <code>y</code> as ""Garbage Out"".  AS a result, the question is whether the issues in the output caused by the code are solely those cases where the data is anomalous, or are there some other instances where good data goes bad?  (This is why I asked a question about <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9167376/how-to-force-an-error-if-non-finite-values-na-nan-or-inf-are-encountered"">stopping when a <code>NaN</code>, <code>NA</code>, or <code>Inf</code> is encountered</a>.)</p>

<p>That also explains why my example has a low probability for <code>TRUE</code> values; these really occur much less than 0.1% of the time.</p>

<p>Does this suggest a different solution path?  Yes: it suggests that we may use two indices (i.e. the locations of <code>TRUE</code> in each set) and count set intersections.  I avoided set intersections because I was burned awhile back by Matlab (yes, this is R, but bear with me), which would first sort elements of a set before it does an intersection.  (I vaguely recall the complexity was even more embarrassing: like <code>O(n^2)</code> instead of <code>O(n log n)</code>.)</p>

Each of the 35 polygons (class ""Polygons"") has its own list of polygons (class ""Polygon""); in total there are 6902 polygons!!!</p>

<p>My understanding of <code>plot()</code> is that I have to pass it a vector of colours in the same order as the polygons will be plotted. Therefore I believe I will have to create a vector of length 6902 with each element holding the colour value for the associated polygon. How am I doing so far?</p>

<p>That would be easy enough if the polygons were plotted in order, but they aren't. Each of the 35 Polygons has a slot <code>plotOrder</code> which is an integer vector, so the colour vector will, presumably, have to be ordered by the values in each of these vectors.</p>

<p>At this point this all seems a bit too complex. Am I completely off track here?</p>

411,find length of sequences of identical values in a numpy array,"<p>In a pylab program (which could probably be a matlab program as well) I have a numpy array of numbers representing distances: <code>d[t]</code> is the <em>distance</em> at time <code>t</code> (and the timespan of my data is <code>len(d)</code> time units).</p>

<p>The events I'm interested in are when the distance is below a certain threshold, and I want to compute the duration of these events.

But I do not know how to do that efficiently (i.e. using numpy primitives), and I resorted to walk the array and to do manual change detection (i.e. initialize counter when value goes from False to True, increase counter as long as value is True, and output the counter to the sequence when value goes back to False).

412,How do I multiply (and divide) BCD numbers by 10^x,"<p>I have a large (12 digit) BCD number, encoded in an array of 6 bytes - each nibble is one BCD digit. I need to multiply it by 10^x, where x can be positive or negative. </p>

<p>I know it can be done by shifting left or right by nibble instead of bit, but it's a horrible implementation - especially in Javacard, which is what I'm using. Is there a better way? </p>

413,Variance of inverse weighted sum,"<p>Let $X$ be a random variable with variance $Var[X]=\sigma^2$. Given a number of (independent) realizations $X_i$, is it possible to estimate the variance of the inverse weighted sum:
$$
Var\left[\frac{1}{\sum_i a_iX_i}\right]
$$
? What I am actually looking for is an estimate of the variance of the above expression <em>without</em> having a particular set of realizations - just knowing the weights $a_i$ and $\overline X$ and $\sigma^2$.</p>

<p>I found the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_method"" rel=""nofollow"">delta method</a>, which is essentially a kind of Taylor expansion:
$$
Var[f(\vec X)] \approx Var[X]\left(\sum_i\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial X_i}f(\vec X)\right)^2\right)\\
=Var[X]\left(\sum_i\left(-\frac{a_i}{2\left(\sum_i a_iX_i\right)^2}\right)^2\right)
$$
However, this expressions still has $X_i$ inside, which doesn't solve my problem.</p>

415,"Given an R dataframe with column A, how do I create two new columns containing all ordered combinations of A","<p>I have a data.frame with one id column (x below), and a number of variables (y1,y2 below).</p>

<p>What I would like to generate from this is a dataframe where the first two columns cover  every ordered combination of x (except where they are equal) along with columns for each variable related to the order.

Thank you very much in advance for your consideration!</p>

<p><strong>Update and additional problem</strong>  </p>

<p>Thanks to mrdwab's helpful reply and comments I made a lot of headway.  </p>

<p>Unfortunately, only now I realized that there also are addresses such as these with more than one author in square brackets. The algorithm proposed by mrdwab doesn't work correctly with these, unfortunately.  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; test = c(""[Bocquet, F.

</code></pre>

<p>This is the result I got:</p>

<pre><code>&gt; test
[1] ""[BOCQUET,  F. C."" ""GIOVANELLI,  L.""  ""ABEL,  M.""        ""PORTE,  L.""

[9] ""PORTE,  L.""       ""FRANCE""           ""[AMSALEM,  P.""    ""HUMBOLDT""        
[13] ""[PETACCIA,  L.""   ""TOPWAL,  D.""      ""GOROVIKOV,  S.""   ""ITALY"" 
</code></pre>

<p>This is the result I'd like to get instead:</p>

<pre><code>[1] ""FRANCE""; ""FRANCE""; ""HUMBOLDT""; ""ITALY""
</code></pre>

<p>I tried using this in order to delete each square bracket and its contents individually:</p>

<pre><code>C1s = gsub(""(.*)[(.*)]"", ""\\2"", C1s)
</code></pre>

<p>But instead of that everything between the first opening bracket and the last closing bracket was deleted ...
Maybe it'd work if I replaced all semicolons within square brackets by commas first? I tried</p>

<pre><code>C1s = gsub(""[(.*);(.*)]"", ""[(.*),(.*)]"", C1s)
</code></pre>

<p>to accomplish that, but it didn't work.<br>
So I'd appreciate your help in that regard!</p>

<p>In addition to that I'm still stuck at yet another obstacle which I just cannot seem to resolve on my own, unfortunately ...<br>
This is my current output:  </p>

<pre><code>&gt; C1s
[1] ""PEOPLES R CHINA"" ""GERMANY""         ""HUMBOLDT""         ""GERMANY""

&gt; dims
[1] 4 2 3 1
&gt; is.list(C1)
[1] FALSE
&gt; is.vector(C1)
[1] TRUE
</code></pre>

<p>But how exactly can I use the information in <em>dims</em> to create this desired output?:  </p>

<pre><code>[1] ""PEOPLES R CHINA""; ""GERMANY""; ""HUMBOLDT""; ""GERMANY""
[2] ""GERMANY""; ""HUMBOLDT""
[3] ""UNITED KINGDOM""; ""USA""; ""HUMBOLDT""
[4] ""USA""

434,R data frame: Assign weights based on frequency of occurrence of values,"<p>I would like to ask you for help with my data frame. It is a vector of many phases and for every one we have names of variables. Lets say </p>

<pre><code>vec&lt;-data.frame(phase1= c(""var1"",""var2"",""var3"",""var4"",""var5"",""var6""),     
                 phase2= c(""var1"",""var3"",""var4"",""var2"",""var6"",""var5""),

  phase1 phase2 phase3
1   var1   var1   var4
2   var2   var3   var3
3   var3   var4   var2
4   var4   var2   var1
5   var5   var6   var6
6   var6   var5   var5
</code></pre>

<p>Now, lets say we are interested for the first 3 rows and therefore the weight of variable in one of them is 1/3, zero otherwise. My function would ideally output sth like that:</p>

<pre><code>          phase1 phase2 phase3
   var1   0.33   0.33    0
   var2   0.33   0       0.33

   var4   0      0.33    0.33
   var5   0      0       0
   var6   0      0       0
</code></pre>

<p>The function should also be applicable for the first 4, 5 or all 6 rows (ie the weights will change then).

435,How to program a complex set of interrelations?,"<p>First, I'm sorry about the title, that was the best I could come up with.</p>

<p>What I mean is something like, a program that tells me that when A goes up, B goes down, which makes C go up, which increases the likelihood that D and E will go down, sending F straight up and so on.</p>

<p>A couple people told me to look into Linear Programming, but it doesn't sound right because I don't want to <em>find</em> an answer ('solve for x to find the best way to whatever'), I want to change the value of one metric and see the ripple effect across other, connected metrics. </p>

<p>For example, suppose I have a factory and I want to estimate the impact a raise for the workers of one sector will have. A raise of 10% will increase sector morale by X, sector productivity by Y and increase costs by Z. This will force us to raise the price of our product to P, if we want to maintain our profit of Q, which might get us out of some stores and actually decrease profit by R.</p>

<p>Now, a raise of 20% over 2 years will increase sector morale by A, sector productivity by B and increase costs by C, but will lower morale from other sectors by D, unless...</p>

<p>I think you can get the idea. What I want is to figure out how to program the underlying network that makes all that happen, based on any relevant input (for example, what would have to change if I wanted to increase sector productivity? I type in the new value for productivity and watch the appropriate connected values update by themselves). </p>

<p>If this is indeed the domain of Linear Programming, could someone provide examples or an explanation centered around that model? I'm having a hard time seeing it.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot.</p>

436,Calculating Euler's Number in C++,"<p><em>Write a program that calculates Euler’s number e. To do this, first write a function that takes a parameter n, and returns the result (1+1/n)<sup>n</sup>. The limit of this function approaches e as n approaches infinity.

On each iteration, multiply n by 2 (if you just add 1 to n each time, the algorithm won' work) and stop when the your new approximation and your previous approximation differ by less than 1e-8.

452,Lower bounds for learning in the membership query and counterexample model,"<p>Dana Angluin (<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0890540187900526"">1987</a>; <a href=""http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/chitti/thesis/references/learningRegSetsFromQueriesAndCounterExamples.pdf"">pdf</a>) defines a learning model with membership queries and theory queries (counterexamples to a proposed function). She shows that a regular language that is represented by a minimal DFA of $n$ states is learnable in polynomial time (where the proposed functions are DFAs) with $O(mn^2)$ membership-queries and at most $n−1$ theory-queries ($m$ is the size of the largest counter-example provided by the tutor). Unfortunately, she does not discuss lower bounds.</p>

<p>We can generalize the model slightly by assuming a magical tutor that can check equality between arbitrary functions and provide counterexamples if different. Then we can ask how hard it is to learn classes bigger than regular languages. I am interested in this generalization and the original restriction to regular languages.</p>

<p><strong>Are there any known lower bounds on the number of queries in the membership and counterexample model?</strong></p>

<p>I am interested in lower bounds on the number of membership queries, theory queries, or trade-offs between the two. I am interested in lower-bounds for any class of functions, even for more complicated classes than regular languages.</p>

<p>If there are no lower-bounds: <strong>Are there known bariers to proving query lower bounds in this model?</strong></p>

<a href=""http://math.berkeley.edu/~shaowei/python.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.berkeley.edu/~shaowei/python.html</a>
I followed these steps:
1. Already had Python 2.7 installed</p>

<ol>
<li>Nose</li>
</ol>

<p>Nose is needed for running tests within Python. The website is at <a href=""http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://readthedocs.org/docs/nose/en/latest/</a>. </p>

<p>I started from the links on <a href=""http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Mac_OS_X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scipy.org/Installing_SciPy/Mac_OS_X</a> and eventually arrived at the SourceForge download site <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy/1.6.1/</a>.</p>

<p>From there, I chose the Mac OS X installer ""numpy-1.6.1-py2.7-python.org-macosx10.3.dmg"". </p>

<p>From Python, run the following test to make sure NumPy is correctly installed.</p>

This gives me the exact same output. I've also tried different encodings, through the <code>encoding</code> option for <code>table.read()</code>. If I look at the internally created vector, mentioned above, it prints the variable names as they should be printed so I guess there is a problem with the conversion between the ""text -> R"" and the ""R -> text"" phases of the process. That is, if I look at the data frame created by <code>read.table()</code> without any internally created vectors, the column names are wrong.</p>

$$D=2\left [ l(\hat{\mu}, \hat{\sigma})-l(\mu_0,\hat{\sigma}) \right ]=\frac{n(\bar{y}-\mu_0)^2}{\hat{\sigma}}=\frac{(\bar{y}-\mu_0)^2}{c\hat{\sigma}}\text{ where }c=\frac{1}{n}$$</p>

<p>So, just to clarify the following things:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I accidentally typed $n-1$. I meant $n$ in the denominator for $\sigma$.</p></li>
<li><p>My log-likelihood function is: $l(\mu, \sigma)=-n\log(\sigma)-\frac{\sum{(y_i-\bar{y})^2}}{2\sigma^2}$</p></li>
<li><p>When I expand my ratio statistic and simplify, the logs cancel because they are identical, and I am left with the equivalent expression of $T^2$. I don't understand how I am supposed to get the expression that I am asked for. Any ideas of what I am doing wrong?</p></li>

468,How can I create a histogram for all variables in a data set with minimal effort in R?,"<p>Exploring a new data set: What is the easiest, quickest way to visualise many (all) variables?</p>

<p>Ideally, the output shows the histograms next to each other with minimal clutter and maximum information. Key to this question is flexibility and stability to deal with large and different data sets. I'm using RStudio and usually deal with large and messy survey data.</p>

<p>One example which comes out of the box of <code>Hmisc</code> and works quite well here is:</p>

<pre><code>library(ggplot2)
str(mpg)

library(Hmisc)
hist.data.frame(mpg)
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, somewhere else I run into problems with data lables (Error in plot.new() : figure margins too large). It also crashed for a larger data set than <code>mpg</code> and I haven't figured out how to control binning. Moreover, I'd prefer a flexible solution in <code>ggplot2</code>. Note that I just started learning R and am used to the comfortable solutions provided by commercial software.</p>

475,Numeral domains in Haskell,"<p>Haskell is more mathematical than many languages because of lambda-calculus, but I think the domains are incomplete for number: we have <code>Integer</code> and <code>Float</code>, for example, but not <code>Positive</code> or <code>Negative</code>, or <code>[1..5]</code> as a domain.
This sometimes makes functions unsafe while the compiler could have catched the type error. For example: <code>5</code>mod<code>0</code> outputs <code>*** Exception: divide by zero</code> at run-time only.
<code>mod :: Integral a =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code> but we could have something like <code>mod :: Integral a, a != 0 =&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a</code>; something like a guard or an interval or another datatype... In a game, I want my character to have a positive number  for its life. Or from 0 to 100, not under, not upper. When he gets hit, I need to call the ugly <code>positive x = if x &gt; 0 then x else 0</code>. Even C has <code>signed</code> and <code>unsigned</code>.</p>

<p>Is it a weakness or are they reasons why there are no ""interval"" domains? Is there a package fixing this?</p>
